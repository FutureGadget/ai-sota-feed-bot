# v1.5 Execution Plan — Source Circuit Breaker + Auto-Recovery

## Goals
1. Suppress repeatedly failing sources temporarily.
2. Auto-recover suppressed sources after cooldown.
3. Keep behavior transparent via health state reporting.

## Deliverables
- Extend `pipeline/source_health.py` with circuit-breaker state
- Collect step skips open-circuit sources
- Workflows continue health updates and recovery checks
- Docs update for operational behavior

## State file
- `data/health/circuit_breaker.json`

## Validation
- Simulate failure streak and confirm source suppression
- Simulate cooldown elapsed and confirm recovery
