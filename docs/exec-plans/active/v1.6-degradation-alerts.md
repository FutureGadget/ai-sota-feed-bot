# v1.6 Execution Plan — Source Degradation Alerts

## Goals
1. Alert when a source circuit transitions from closed -> open.
2. Alert when a source remains open beyond a prolonged threshold.
3. Keep alerts low-noise and machine-readable.

## Deliverables
- `pipeline/source_alerts.py`
- `data/health/alerts_state.json`
- workflow step to run alert check and optional Telegram alert

## Trigger conditions
- `opened_now`: source circuit is open and previous state was closed
- `still_open_too_long`: source open duration exceeds threshold (default 12h) and not recently alerted

## Validation
- Generate alert payload from current health/circuit files
- Ensure no duplicate spam within cooldown window
