## Phase A (done)
- Add LLM label pass with cache
- Add config for model/provider and enable flag
- Integrate labels into scoring path with safe fallback

## Phase B (current)
- Add LLM rerank on top-N candidates
- Enforce quota constraints in rerank output
- Fallback to heuristic ordering if rerank fails

## Phase C
- Publish polish: concise Telegram with top-5 why-it-matters
- Better issue formatting and diagnostics
