# v1.2 Execution Plan — Ranking Balance + Feedback Loop

## Goals
1. Prevent release-heavy digests by enforcing content-type diversity.
2. Add a lightweight feedback capture loop for relevance tuning.

## Scope
- Update ranking pipeline to support per-type caps and balanced selection.
- Add local feedback capture utility (`feedback.py`) with summary output.
- Update Telegram output to include feedback instructions.
- Update docs/specs.

## Non-goals (this iteration)
- Full online learning model
- Telegram callback webhooks and persistent backend

## Deliverables
- `pipeline/build_digest.py` diversity-aware ranking
- `pipeline/feedback.py` capture + summarize feedback events
- `config/profile.yaml` with `diversity` config
- Updated docs and onboarding notes

## Validation
- Local run: collect -> digest builds successfully
- Digest shows mixed item types when available
- Feedback command appends valid events and shows summary
