# v1.4 Execution Plan — Source Reliability + Freshness Health

## Goals
1. Track source ingestion health over time.
2. Penalize flaky/stale sources in ranking without hard exclusion.

## Deliverables
- `pipeline/source_health.py` for health update/report
- `collectors/collect.py` writes ingest stats per source
- `pipeline/build_digest.py` incorporates reliability score
- workflow updates for health update/report

## Data artifacts
- `data/health/source_health.json`
- `data/health/ingest_runs.jsonl`

## Validation
- Run collect/build and confirm health artifacts update
- Verify ranking includes `source_reliability`
- Verify report command output is sane
