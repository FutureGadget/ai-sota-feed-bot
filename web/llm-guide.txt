AI SOTA Feed Bot — LLM Navigation Guide

Purpose
- This guide explains how an LLM should reliably extract, filter, and summarize content from this site.

1) Entry points
- Start at: https://ai-sota-feed-bot.vercel.app/api/feed?limit=200
- Optional RSS fallback: /api/rss

2) Reading strategy
- Always inspect `runs[0].run_at` first to confirm freshness.
- Use API fields over HTML scraping whenever possible.
- Prefer `items[].summary_1line` and `why_it_matters` for concise summaries.

3) Filtering strategy
A. By label
- Use `label` repeatedly or `labels` CSV.
- Useful labels include: platform, release, research, frontier_official, practitioner_analysis, community_signal, research_watch.

B. By source
- Filter items by `source` field client-side.
- Common frontier sources:
  - openai_blog
  - anthropic_newsroom
  - anthropic_engineering
  - claude_blog

C. By time
- Use `from`/`to` query params in ISO format.
- If user says "missing", first widen to all-time window and higher limit.

4) Diagnosing "missing item" cases
Checklist:
1. Confirm item exists in raw/Tier-1 path (if you have backend access).
2. Check if homepage preset window excludes it.
3. Check if Tier-0 ranked output excludes it due to slot caps/diversity constraints.
4. Confirm production deployment is on latest run (`runs[0].run_at`).

5) Interpreting key fields
- `tier`: origin lane (often tier1 in merged output)
- `v2_slot`: slot chosen by ranker (frontier_official, etc.)
- `v2_final_score`: final ranking score
- `labels`: derived labels for quick filtering
- `first_seen` / `last_seen`: recency and persistence across runs

6) Safe output format for end users
- Prefer short, factual summaries.
- Include why an item may not be visible (time window vs ranking vs deployment lag).
- Avoid exposing internal-only debugging details unless requested.

7) Suggested prompt template for downstream LLM tools
"Fetch /api/feed with a wide window and summarize top items by `v2_final_score`. Group by `v2_slot`, and highlight frontier_official updates. If a requested URL is missing, diagnose by checking date window, slot caps, and production run freshness."
