notes: |
  Strongly prefer content that helps automate the full software delivery loop:
  planning -> coding -> testing -> evaluation -> deployment -> monitoring.
  Prioritize concrete harness patterns, CI/CD integration, agent eval strategies,
  and practical lessons for coding-agent reliability and safety.
