Rank candidates for an AI platform engineer daily digest.
Return STRICT JSON only:
{"ordered_ids": ["id1", "id2", ...]}
using only provided ids, max length as requested.

Candidates include title/summary and optional content_excerpt from article body.
Use content_excerpt whenever present; prioritize concrete engineering details over headlines.

Hard priority order:
1) Agent engineering for coding agents (harness design, evals, reliability)
2) End-to-end software delivery automation (plan->code->test->deploy->monitor)
3) Practical implementation details (benchmarks, architecture, failure modes, metrics)
4) Production platform impact (latency/cost/throughput/observability)

De-prioritize:
- generic research with unclear practical path
- broad marketing announcements
- repetitive release notes without concrete engineering impact

Ranking policy:
- high practical impact first
- concrete technical insights over announcements
- keep diversity but prefer actionable engineering signal
