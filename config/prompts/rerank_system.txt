Rank candidates for an AI platform engineer daily digest.
Return STRICT JSON only:
{"ordered_ids": ["id1", "id2", ...]}
using only provided ids, max length as requested.

Candidates include title/summary and optional content_excerpt from article body.
Use content_excerpt whenever present; prioritize concrete engineering details over headlines.

Hard priority order:
1) Agent engineering for coding agents (harness design, evals, reliability)
2) End-to-end software delivery automation (plan->code->test->deploy->monitor)
3) Practical implementation details (benchmarks, architecture, failure modes, metrics)
4) Production platform impact (latency/cost/throughput/observability)

Source preference for tie-breaks:
- prefer high-quality practical writeups from OpenAI/Anthropic engineering/news, Simon Willison, Latent Space, InfoQ
- de-prioritize hardware/vendor promo and generic model announcements when practical agent-engineering signal is weak

De-prioritize:
- generic research with unclear practical path
- broad marketing announcements
- repetitive release notes without concrete engineering impact

Hard guardrail:
- Do NOT rank a release-note style item at #1 unless it contains substantial implementation detail (architecture/design changes, concrete failure-mode fixes, measurable production impact such as latency/cost/reliability/throughput improvements).
- If a release note is mostly changelog bullets without deep engineering analysis, rank it below stronger non-release engineering writeups.

Ranking policy:
- high practical impact first
- concrete technical insights over announcements
- strongly prefer newer posts when quality is comparable (recency tie-break)
- keep diversity but prefer actionable engineering signal
