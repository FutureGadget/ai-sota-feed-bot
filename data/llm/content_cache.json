GPG key ID: B5690EEEBB952194 Verified Learn about vigilant mode . Triton Inference Server The Triton Inference Server provides a cloud inferencing solution optimized for both CPUs and GPUs. The server provides an inference service via an HTTP or GRPC endpoint, allowing remote clients to request inferencing for any model being managed by the server. For edge deployments, Triton Server is also available as a shared library with an API that allows the full functionality of the server to be included directly in an application. New Features and Improvements Improved ensemble model performance in scenarios that allow out-of-order responses by increasing maximum throughput and reducing latency. Known Issues TensorRT calibration cache may require size adjustment in some cases, which was observed for the IGX platform. The core Python binding may incur an additional D2H and H2D copy if the backend and frontend both specify device memory to be used for response tensors. A segmentation fault related to DCGM and NSCQ may be encountered during server shutdown on NVSwitch systems. A possible workaround for this issue is to disable the collection of GPU metrics tritonserver --allow-gpu-metrics false ... vLLM backend currently does not take advantage of the vLLM v0.6 performance improvement when metrics are enabled. When using TensorRT models, if auto-complete configuration is disabled and is_non_linear_format_io:true for reformat-free tensors is not provided in the model configuration, the model may not load successfully. When using Python models in decoupled mode , users need to ensure that the ResponseSender goes out of scope or is properly cleaned up before unloading the model to guarantee that the unloading process executes correctly. Restart support was temporarily removed for Python model",

For edge deployments, Triton Server is also available as a shared library with an API that allows the full functionality of the server to be included directly in an application. New Features and Improvements Exposed gRPC infer thread count as a server option. Improved server stability during the gRPC client cancellation. Improved server stability in tracing mode. Added BLS decoupled request cancellation in the Python Backend GenAI-Perf now offers a new configuration file alongside the command line. GenAI-Perf now supports the Huggingface TGI generated endpoint. GenAI-Perf added a Token per second per user (TPS/user) metric. GenAI-Perf metric parsing speed was increased by 60%. Known Issues vLLM backend for 25.04 might be unstable with the vLLM V1 architecture. We recommend switching to V0 for this release, by setting VLLM_USE_V1 environment variable to 0. However, users should be aware that vLLM's V0 API is affected by vulnerabilities. vLLM containers include vllm version 0.8.1 which is affected by new vulnerabilities. Workarounds: Prior to the fix, your options include: Do not expose the vLLM host to a network where any untrusted connections may reach the host. Ensure that only the other vLLM hosts are able to connect to the TCP port used for the XPUB socket. Note that port used is random.

Perf Analyzer dependencies were made optional when installing tritonclient via pip. Added support for nv_inference_first_response_histogram_ms metric when running models in coupled (aka non-decoupled) mode. Fixed an issue where a crashed Python backend stub process was not correctly detected leading to failed inference requests. Fixed an issue where a malicious HTTP request could exhaust all available system memory leading to a process crash or denial of service. Fixed an issue where loading a TensorRT engine larger than 30GB could cause out of memory errors despite sufficient memory to load the engine being available. Known Issues If you are using the vllm backend to run models that accept video inputs, then do not upgrade to Triton 26.01 and wait for Triton 26.02 Triton python package uses outdated dependency starlette package version. Since 25.10, vLLM backend uses V1 engine by default. You might see invalid characters in logprobs output and the bug has been reported to the vLLM team.

Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

February 12, 2026 by Shruti Koparkar Share Email 0 A diagnostic insight in healthcare. A character’s dialogue in an interactive game. An autonomous resolution from a customer service agent. Each of these AI-powered interactions is built on the same unit of intelligence: a token . Scaling these AI interactions requires businesses to consider whether they can afford more tokens. The answer lies in better tokenomics — which at its core is about driving down the cost of each token. This downward trend is unfolding across industries. Recent MIT research found that infrastructure and algorithmic efficiencies are reducing inference costs for frontier-level performance by up to 10x annually. To understand how infrastructure efficiency improves tokenomics, consider the analogy of a high-speed printing press. If the press produces 10x output with incremental investment in ink, energy and the machine itself, the cost to print each individual page drops. In the same way, investments in AI infrastructure can lead to far greater token output compared with the increase in cost — causing a meaningful reduction in the cost per token. When token output outpaces infrastructure cost, the cost of each token drops. That’s why leading inference providers including Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks AI and Together AI are using the NVIDIA Blackwell platform , which helps them reduce cost per token by up to 10x compared with the NVIDIA Hopper platform. These providers host advanced open source models, which have now reached frontier-level intelligence. By combining open source frontier intelligence, the extreme hardware-software codesign of NVIDIA Blackwell and their own optimized inference stacks, these providers are enabling dramatic token cost reductions for businesses across every industry. Healthcare — Baseten and Sully.ai Cut AI Inference Costs by 10x In healthcare, tedious, time-consuming tasks like medical coding, documentation and managing insurance forms cut into the time doctors can spend with patients. Sully.ai helps solve this problem by developing “AI employees” that can handle routine tasks like medical coding and note-taking. As the company’s platform scaled, its proprietary, closed source models created three bottlenecks: unpredictable latency in real-time clinical workflows, inference costs that scaled faster than revenue and insufficient control over model quality and updates. Sully.ai builds AI employees that handle routine tasks for physicians. To overcome these bottlenecks, Sully.ai uses Baseten’s Model API , which deploys open source models such as gpt-oss-120b on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. Baseten used the low-precision NVFP4 data format, the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library and the NVIDIA Dynamo inference framework to deliver optimized inference. The company chose NVIDIA Blackwell to run its Model API after seeing up to 2.5x better throughput per dollar compared with the NVIDIA Hopper platform. As a result, Sully.ai ’s inference costs dropped by 90%, representing a 10x reduction compared with the prior closed source implementation, while response times improved by 65% for critical workflows like generating medical notes. The company has now returned over 30 million minutes to physicians, time previously lost to data entry and other manual tasks. Gaming — DeepInfra and Latitude Reduce Cost per Token by 4x Latitude is building the future of AI-native gaming with its AI Dungeon adventure-story game and upcoming AI-powered role-playing gaming platform, Voyage, where players can create or play worlds with the freedom to choose any action and make their own story. The company’s platform uses large language models to respond to players’ actions — but this comes with scaling challenges, as every player action triggers an inference request. Costs scale with engagement, and response times must stay fast enough to keep the experience seamless. Latitude has built a text-based adventure-story game called “AI Dungeon,” which generates both narrative text and imagery in real time as players explore dynamic stories. Latitude runs large open source models on DeepInfra’s inference platform, powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and TensorRT-LLM . For a large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, DeepInfra reduced the cost per million tokens from 20 cents on the NVIDIA Hopper platform to 10 cents on Blackwell.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

Mahoney , Kurt Keutzer , Amir Gholami View a PDF of the paper titled Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents, by Nicholas Lee and 6 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

Metaxas View a PDF of the paper titled T3D: Few-Step Diffusion Language Models via Trajectory Self-Distillation with Direct Discriminative Optimization, by Tunyu Zhang and 11 other authors View PDF Abstract: Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at this https URL .

This shift has fundamentally reshaped how web content gains exposure online, giving rise to Search-Augmented Generative Engine Optimization (SAGEO), the practice of optimizing web documents to improve their visibility in AI-generated responses. Despite growing interest, no evaluation environment currently supports comprehensive investigation of SAGEO. Specifically, existing benchmarks lack end-to-end visibility evaluation of optimization strategies, operating on pre-determined candidate documents that abstract away retrieval and reranking preceding generation. Moreover, existing benchmarks discard structural information (e.g., schema markup) present in real web documents, overlooking the rich signals that search systems actively leverage in practice. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce SAGEO Arena, a realistic and reproducible environment for stage-level SAGEO analysis. Our objective is to jointly target search-oriented optimization (SEO) and generation-centric optimization (GEO). To achieve this, we integrate a full generative search pipeline over a large-scale corpus of web documents with rich structural information. Our findings reveal that existing approaches remain largely impractical under realistic conditions and often degrade performance in retrieval and reranking. We also find that structural information helps mitigate these limitations, and that effective SAGEO requires tailoring optimization to each pipeline stage. Overall, our benchmark paves the way for realistic SAGEO evaluation and optimization beyond simplified settings.

That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language. This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers. We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's \"bitter lesson\" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier.

Grimm , Martin Grohe View a PDF of the paper titled Amortized Molecular Optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization, by Muhammad bin Javaid and 7 other authors View PDF Abstract: Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as \"Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.

We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data. Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights. Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.

Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

Bayesian Optimization has emerged as a sample-efficient framework for this problem. However, the basic setting considered by these methods is simplified compared to real-world experimental setups, where experiments often generate a wealth of useful information. We introduce a new setting where an experiment generates high-dimensional auxiliary information $h(x)$ along with the performance measure $f(x)$; moreover, a history of previously solved tasks from the same task family is available for accelerating optimization. A key challenge of our setting is learning how to represent and utilize $h(x)$ for efficiently solving new optimization tasks beyond the task history. We develop a novel approach for this setting based on a neural model which predicts $f(x)$ for unseen designs given a few-shot context containing observations of $h(x)$. We evaluate our method on two challenging domains, robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning, and introduce a novel design problem and large-scale benchmark for the former. On both domains, our method utilizes auxiliary feedback effectively to achieve more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization of design tasks, significantly outperforming several methods for multi-task optimization.

We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs. Subjects: Machine Learning (cs.LG) Cite as: arXiv:2602.12049 [cs.LG] (or arXiv:2602.12049v1 [cs.LG] for this version) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2602.12049 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite (pending registration) Submission history From: Daichi Mukunoki [ view email ] [v1] Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:12:59 UTC (170 KB) Full-text links: Access Paper: View a PDF of the paper titled Improving HPC Code Generation Capability of LLMs via Online Reinforcement Learning with Real-Machine Benchmark Rewards, by Ryo Mikasa and 4 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) TeX Source view license Current browse context: cs.LG < prev | next > new | recent | 2026-02 Change to browse by: cs References & Citations NASA ADS Google Scholar Semantic Scholar export BibTeX citation Loading...

    "text": "An OpenClaw agent wrote a blog post about my site and misquoted me | Nick’s Thoughts Nick's Thoughts An OpenClaw agent wrote a blog post about my site and misquoted me Feb 14, 2026 A few days ago, I posted to Hacker News about a side project I’ve been working on, agentalcove.ai , but that’s beside the point and only included in this post for context. Today, I was curious to see what would show up on Google if I searched up “agent alcove” (as one does after publishing their first web app), and I found this blog post. I couldn’t believe my eyes. An OpenClaw agent named “Ravel” had written an entire article about my site on their blog, The Daily Molt . The contents of the post are relatively benign, except for one section. Ignoring the fact that you can find my identity relatively easily via my HN profile, I was mainly concerned with the highlighted quote. The article claims I called OpenClaw “an atomic bomb of a security hole waiting to explode.” I never said that. I determined that “Ravel” had taken this quote from HN user panza, who wrote “It’s also an atomic bomb of a security hole waiting to explode” in a reply to me in an entirely different HN thread . After reading Scott Shambaugh’s blog post detailing an Ars Technica article (also written by AI) misquoting him as well, I thought I would share my experience. The misquote in my case wasn’t malicious, but it easily could have been, and I worry about the implications of allowing AI models to produce content unregulated.",

    "text": "Two different tricks for fast LLM inference sean goedecke February 15, 2026 │ ai Two different tricks for fast LLM inference Anthropic and OpenAI both recently announced “fast mode”: a way to interact with their best coding model at significantly higher speeds. These two versions of fast mode are very different. Anthropic’s offers up to 2.5x tokens per second (so around 170, up from Opus 4.6’s 65). OpenAI’s offers more than 1000 tokens per second (up from GPT-5.3-Codex’s 65 tokens per second, so 15x). So OpenAI’s fast mode is six times faster than Anthropic’s 1 . However, Anthropic’s big advantage is that they’re serving their actual model. When you use their fast mode, you get real Opus 4.6, while when you use OpenAI’s fast mode you get GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, not the real GPT-5.3-Codex. Spark is indeed much faster, but is a notably less capable model: good enough for many tasks, but it gets confused and messes up tool calls in ways that vanilla GPT-5.3-Codex would never do. Why the differences? The AI labs aren’t advertising the details of how their fast modes work, but I’m pretty confident it’s something like this: Anthropic’s fast mode is backed by low-batch-size inference, while OpenAI’s fast mode is backed by special monster Cerebras chips . Let me unpack that a bit. How Anthropic’s fast mode works The tradeoff at the heart of AI inference economics is batching , because the main bottleneck is memory . GPUs are very fast, but moving data onto a GPU is not. Every inference operation requires copying all the tokens of the user’s prompt 2 onto the GPU before inference can start. Batching multiple users up thus increases overall throughput at the cost of making users wait for the batch to be full. A good analogy is a bus system. If you had zero batching for passengers - if, whenever someone got on a bus, the bus departed immediately - commutes would be much faster for the people who managed to get on a bus . But obviously overall throughput would be much lower, because people would be waiting at the bus stop for hours until they managed to actually get on one. Anthropic’s fast mode offering is basically a bus pass that guarantees that the bus immediately leaves as soon as you get on. It’s six times the cost, because you’re effectively paying for all the other people who could have got on the bus with you, but it’s way faster 3 because you spend zero time waiting for the bus to leave. Obviously I can’t be fully certain this is right. Maybe they have access to some new ultra-fast compute that they’re running this on, or they’re doing some algorithmic trick nobody else has thought of. But I’m pretty sure this is it. Brand new compute or algorithmic tricks would likely require changes to the model (see below for OpenAI’s system), and “six times more expensive for 2.5x faster” is right in the ballpark for the kind of improvement you’d expect when switching to a low-batch-size regime. How OpenAI’s fast mode works OpenAI’s fast mode does not work anything like this. You can tell that simply because they’re introducing a new, worse model for it. There would be absolutely no reason to do that if they were simply tweaking batch sizes. Also, they told us in the announcement blog post exactly what’s backing their fast mode: Cerebras. OpenAI announced their Cerebras partnership a month ago in January. What’s Cerebras? They build “ultra low-latency compute”. What this means in practice is that they build giant chips . A H100 chip (fairly close to the frontier of inference chips) is just over a square inch in size. A Cerebras chip is 70 square inches. You can see from pictures that the Cerebras chip has a grid-and-holes pattern all over it. That’s because silicon wafers this big are supposed to be broken into dozens of chips. Instead, Cerebras etches a giant chip over the entire thing. The larger the chip, the more internal memory it can have. The idea is to have a chip with SRAM large enough to fit the entire model , so inference can happen entirely in-memory. Typically GPU SRAM is measured in the tens of megabytes . That means that a lot of inference time is spent streaming portions of the model weights from outside of SRAM into the GPU compute 4 . If you could stream all of that from the (much faster) SRAM, inference would a big speedup: fifteen times faster, as it turns out! So how much internal memory does the latest Cerebras chip have? 44GB . This puts OpenAI in kind of an awkward position. 44GB is enough to fit a small model (~20B params at fp16, ~40B params at int8 quantization), but clearly not enough to fit GPT-5.3-Codex. That’s why they’re offering a brand new model, and why the Spark model has a bit of “small model smell” to it: it’s a smaller distil of the much larger GPT-5.3-Codex model 5 . OpenAI’s version is much more technically impressive It’s interesting that the two major labs have two very different approaches to building fast AI inference.

The product has internal daily users and external alpha testers. It ships, deploys, breaks, and gets fixed. What’s different is that every line of code—application logic, tests, CI configuration, documentation, observability, and internal tooling—has been written by Codex. We estimate that we built this in about 1/10th the time it would have taken to write the code by hand. Humans steer. Agents execute. We intentionally chose this constraint so we would build what was necessary to increase engineering velocity by orders of magnitude. We had weeks to ship what ended up being a million lines of code. To do that, we needed to understand what changes when a software engineering team’s primary job is no longer to write code, but to design environments, specify intent, and build feedback loops that allow Codex agents to do reliable work. This post is about what we learned by building a brand new product with a team of agents—what broke, what compounded, and how to maximize our one truly scarce resource: human time and attention. We started with an empty git repository The first commit to an empty repository landed in late August 2025. The initial scaffold—repository structure, CI configuration, formatting rules, package manager setup, and application framework—was generated by Codex CLI using GPT‑5, guided by a small set of existing templates. Even the initial AGENTS.md file that directs agents how to work in the repository was itself written by Codex. There was no pre-existing human-written code to anchor the system. From the beginning, the repository was shaped by the agent. Five months later, the repository contains on the order of a million lines of code across application logic, infrastructure, tooling, documentation, and internal developer utilities. Over that period, roughly 1,500 pull requests have been opened and merged with a small team of just three engineers driving Codex. This translates to an average throughput of 3.5 PRs per engineer per day, and surprisingly the throughput has increased as the team has grown to now seven engineers. Importantly, this wasn’t output for output’s sake: the product has been used by hundreds of users internally, including daily internal power users. Throughout the development process, humans never directly contributed any code. This became a core philosophy for the team: no manually-written code . Redefining the role of the engineer The lack of hands-on human coding introduced a different kind of engineering work, focused on systems, scaffolding, and leverage . Early progress was slower than we expected, not because Codex was incapable, but because the environment was underspecified. The agent lacked the tools, abstractions, and internal structure required to make progress toward high-level goals. The primary job of our engineering team became enabling the agents to do useful work. In practice, this meant working depth-first: breaking down larger goals into smaller building blocks (design, code, review, test, etc), prompting the agent to construct those blocks, and using them to unlock more complex tasks. When something failed, the fix was almost never “try harder.” Because the only way to make progress was to get Codex to do the work, human engineers always stepped into the ",

Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

However, existing retrieval models are not designed for long document retrieval and fail to address several key challenges of long document retrieval, including context-awareness, causal dependence, and scope of retrieval. In this paper, we proposed AttentionRetriever, a novel long document retrieval model that leverages attention mechanism and entity-based retrieval to build context-aware embeddings for long document and determine the scope of retrieval. With extensive experiments, we found AttentionRetriever is able to outperform existing retrieval models on long document retrieval datasets by a large margin while remaining as efficient as dense retrieval models.

We argue that existing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work if it could not have been generated without that work in its training corpus. To operationalize this definition, we model generative systems as closure operators mapping a corpus of existing works to an output of new works. AI generated outputs are \\emph{permissible} if they do not infringe on any existing work according to our criterion. Our results characterize structural properties of permissible generation and reveal a sharp asymptotic dichotomy: when the process of organic creations is light-tailed, dependence on individual works eventually vanishes, so that regulation imposes no limits on AI generation; with heavy-tailed creations, regulation can be persistently constraining.
