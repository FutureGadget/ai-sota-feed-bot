    "title": "Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13194v1",
    "summary": "The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13191v1",
    "summary": "Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13166v1",
    "summary": "This paper presents a hybrid obstacle avoidance architecture that integrates Optimal Control under clearance with a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS) to enable adaptive constraint handling for unmanned aircraft. Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13165v1",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \\textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13156v1",
    "summary": "Rapidly evolving cyberattacks demand incident response systems that can autonomously learn and adapt to changing threats. Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.",

ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains. We define non-ground semantics for CABA, in terms of various notions of non-ground attacks. We show that the new semantics conservatively generalise standard ABA semantics.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13110v1",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to replace costly human preference labels in pairwise evaluation. Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B. Compared to naïve baselines, \\textsc{Scope} accepts up to $2.4\\times$ more judgments on MT-Bench with Qwen-7B under the same target risk constraint, demonstrating that BPE enables reliable and high-coverage LLM-based evaluation.",

    "title": "Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1",
    "summary": "In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.",

    "summary": "Large reasoning models with reasoning capabilities achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.",

    "summary": "The distinction between genuine grassroots activism and automated influence operations is collapsing. While policy debates focus on bot farms, a distinct threat to democracy is emerging via partisan coordination apps and artificial intelligence-what we term 'cyborg propaganda.' This architecture combines large numbers of verified humans with adaptive algorithmic automation, enabling a closed-loop system. AI tools monitor online sentiment to optimize directives and generate personalized content for users to post online. Cyborg propaganda thereby exploits a critical legal shield: by relying on verified citizens to ratify and disseminate messages, these campaigns operate in a regulatory gray zone, evading liability frameworks designed for automated botnets. We explore the collective action paradox of this technology: does it democratize power by 'unionizing' influence (pooling the reach of dispersed citizens to overcome the algorithmic invisibility of isolated voices), or does it reduce citizens to 'cognitive proxies' of a central directive? We argue that cyborg propaganda fundamentally alters the digital public square, shifting political discourse from a democratic contest of individual ideas to a battle of algorithmic campaigns. We outline a research agenda to distinguish organic from coordinated information diffusion and propose governance frameworks to address the regulatory challenges of AI-assisted collective expression.",

    "summary": "Deep learning has significantly improved time series classification, yet the lack of explainability in these models remains a major challenge. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.",

    "summary": "Mobility trajectory data provide essential support for smart city applications. However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.",

However, deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by a critical extrapolation hazard: driven by smoothness biases, flow models yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, resulting in silent failures indistinguishable from valid predictions. In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13055v1",
    "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

    "summary": "Conversational speech often reveals early signs of cognitive decline, such as dementia and MCI. In the UK, one in four people belongs to an ethnic minority, and dementia prevalence is expected to rise most rapidly among Black and Asian communities. This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models.",

    "summary": "Imbalanced classification presents a formidable challenge in machine learning, particularly when tabular datasets are plagued by noise and overlapping class boundaries. From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.",

We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier of digital infrastructure that can support a wide range of public-sector applications, from general purpose citizen services to specialized and sensitive state functions. When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, \"building\" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13021v1",
    "summary": "Symbolic Regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable equations from observational data, with the potential to reveal underlying principles behind natural phenomena. However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.",

To assess the accuracy and interpretability of these RNN policies, we consider the challenging lane-keeping control task and evaluate performance across multiple metrics, including turn-weighted validation loss, neural activity during driving, absolute correlation between neural activity and road trajectory, saliency maps of the networks' attention, and the robustness of their saliency maps measured by the structural similarity index.",

Our approach leverages internal cognitive signals to partition the knowledge space into mastered, confused, and missing regions, guiding targeted knowledge expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a cognitive consistency mechanism to synchronize subjective certainty with objective accuracy, ensuring calibrated knowledge boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its rationality in not only enhancing knowledge capabilities but also fostering cognitive behaviors that better distinguish knowns from unknowns.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12983v1",
    "summary": "Real-time online object tracking in videos constitutes a core task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications including video surveillance, motion capture, and robotics. Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.",

    "summary": "Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.",

However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.",

Other ways of measuring the variation of a probability distribution exist which have the advantage of taking into account the full probability distribution, for example the Shannon entropy. We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature.",

    "summary": "Proactive intent prediction is a critical capability in modern e-commerce chatbots, enabling \"zero-query\" recommendations by anticipating user needs from behavioral and contextual signals. However, existing industrial systems face two fundamental challenges: (1) the semantic gap between discrete user features and the semantic intents within the chatbot's Knowledge Base, and (2) the objective misalignment between general-purpose LLM outputs and task-specific ranking utilities. To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM's latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems.",

We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \\log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \\log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the \"implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have extensively explored NPU architectures for accelerating AI inference in on-device environments, which are inherently resource-constrained. Meanwhile, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have become dominant, with rapidly increasing model sizes but low degree of parameter reuse compared to conventional CNNs, making end-to-end execution on resource-limited devices extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss.",

While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically.",

    "summary": "Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are common and spatially heterogeneous lesions, complicating cohort-level analyses due to anatomical variability and differing MRI protocols. We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies.",

    "summary": "Generative Social Agents (GSAs) are increasingly impacting human users through persuasive means. On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication.",

Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning.

    "summary": "Purpose: Spinal instability is a widespread condition that causes pain, fatigue, and restricted mobility, profoundly affecting patients' quality of life. In clinical practice, the gold standard for diagnosis is dynamic X-ray imaging. However, X-ray provides only 2D motion information, while 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) cannot efficiently capture motion. Therefore, there is a need for a system capable of visualizing real-time 3D spinal motion while minimizing radiation exposure.\n  Methods: We propose ultrasound as an auxiliary modality for 3D spine visualization. Due to acoustic limitations, ultrasound captures only the superficial spinal surface. Therefore, the partially compounded ultrasound volume is registered to preoperative 3D imaging. In this study, CBCT provides the neutral spine configuration, while robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed at maximal spinal bending. A kinematic model is applied to the CBCT-derived spine model for coarse registration, followed by ICP for fine registration, with kinematic parameters optimized based on the registration results. Real-time ultrasound motion tracking is then used to estimate continuous 3D spinal motion by interpolating between the neutral and maximally bent states.\n  Results: The pipeline was evaluated on a bendable 3D-printed lumbar spine phantom. The registration error was $1.941 \\pm 0.199$ mm and the interpolated spinal motion error was $2.01 \\pm 0.309$ mm (median).\n  Conclusion: The proposed robotic ultrasound framework enables radiation-reduced, real-time 3D visualization of spinal motion, offering a promising 3D alternative to conventional dynamic X-ray imaging for assessing spinal instability.",

    "summary": "As self-driving technology advances toward widespread adoption, determining safe operational thresholds across varying environmental conditions becomes critical for public safety. This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained.",

    "summary": "Pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) provide a knowledge-rich foundation for post-training by leveraging their inherent perception and reasoning capabilities to solve complex tasks. However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently.

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), equipped with increasingly advanced planning and tool-use capabilities, are evolving into autonomous agents capable of performing multimodal web browsing and deep search in open-world environments. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12875v1",
    "summary": "The Microservices Architecture (MSA) design pattern has become a staple for modern applications, allowing functionalities to be divided across fine-grained microservices, fostering reusability, distribution, and interoperability. As MSA-based applications are deployed to the Computing Continuum (CC), meeting their Service Level Objectives (SLOs) becomes a challenge. Trading off performance and sustainability SLOs is especially challenging. This challenge can be addressed with intelligent decision systems, able to reconfigure the services during runtime to meet the SLOs. However, developing these agents while adhering to the MSA pattern is complex, especially because CC providers, who have key know-how and information to fulfill these SLOs, must comply with the privacy requirements of application developers. This work presents the Carbon-Aware SLO and Control plAtform (CASCA), an open-source MSA-based platform that allows CC providers to reconfigure services and fulfill their SLOs while maintaining the privacy of developers. CASCA is architected to be highly reusable, distributable, and easy to use, extend, and modify. CASCA has been evaluated in a real CC testbed for a media streaming service, where decision systems implemented in Bash, Rust, and Python successfully reconfigured the service, unaffected by upholding privacy.",

    "summary": "Generative social robots (GSRs) powered by large language models enable adaptive, conversational tutoring but also introduce risks such as hallucina-tions, overreliance, and privacy violations. Existing frameworks for educa-tional technologies and responsible AI primarily define desired behaviors, yet they rarely specify the knowledge prerequisites that enable generative systems to express these behaviors reliably. To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutor-ing-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university stu-dents and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly per-sonality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educa-tional strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environ-ment). By identifying these knowledge requirements, this work provides a structured foundation for the design of tutoring GSRs and future evaluations, aligning generative system capabilities with pedagogical and ethical expecta-tions.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12869v1",
    "summary": "Wake vortices are strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft, and they pose a major safety and capacity challenge for air traffic management. Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.",

    "summary": "Deep Research systems based on web agents have shown strong potential in solving complex information-seeking tasks, yet their search efficiency remains underexplored. We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design.",

    "summary": "The ability to learn manipulation skills by watching videos of humans has the potential to unlock a new source of highly scalable data for robot learning. Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.",

    "summary": "Effective water resource management depends on accurate projections of flows in water channels. For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13177v1",
    "summary": "OMD and its variants give a flexible framework for OCO where the performance depends crucially on the choice of the mirror map. While the geometries underlying OPGD and OEG, both special cases of OMD, are well understood, it remains a challenging open question on how to construct an optimal mirror map for any given constrained set and a general family of loss functions, e.g., sparse losses. Motivated by parameterizing a near-optimal set of mirror maps, we consider a simpler question: is it even possible to obtain polynomial gains in regret by using mirror maps for geometries that interpolate between $L_1$ and $L_2$, which may not be possible by restricting to only OEG ($L_1$) or OPGD ($L_2$).\n  Our main result answers this question positively. We show that mirror maps based on block norms adapt better to the sparsity of loss functions, compared to previous $L_p$ (for $p \\in [1, 2]$) interpolations. In particular, we construct a family of online convex optimization instances in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where block norm-based mirror maps achieve a provable polynomial (in $d$) improvement in regret over OEG and OPGD for sparse loss functions. We then turn to the setting in which the sparsity level of the loss functions is unknown. In this case, the choice of geometry itself becomes an online decision problem. We first show that naively switching between OEG and OPGD can incur linear regret, highlighting the intrinsic difficulty of geometry selection. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta-algorithm based on multiplicative weights that dynamically selects among a family of uniform block norms. We show that this approach effectively tunes OMD to the sparsity of the losses, yielding adaptive regret guarantees. Overall, our results demonstrate that online mirror-map selection can significantly enhance the ability of OMD to exploit sparsity in online convex optimization.",

Specifically, we embed neural networks into the PDE and show how, as they are trained on data, they can approximate unknown functions with arbitrary accuracy. Using nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations as a case study, we recover interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data. Specifically, we investigate how a wide range of factors, such as the number of available solutions, their properties, sampling density, and measurement noise, affect our ability to successfully recover functions. Our approach is advantageous because it can utilise standard parameter-fitting workflows, and in that the trained PDE can be treated as a normal PDE for purposes such as generating system predictions.",

    "summary": "With the advancement of face recognition (FR) systems, privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) systems have gained popularity for their accurate recognition, enhanced facial privacy protection, and robustness to various attacks. However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets.",

    "summary": "There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.",

    "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",

    "summary": "Graph neural network (GNN) potentials such as SchNet improve the accuracy and transferability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by learning many-body interactions, but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.",

    "summary": "Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.",

    "summary": "Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a low-complexity and energy-efficient alternative to traditional full-precision neural networks by constraining their weights and activations to binary values. However, their discrete, highly non-linear behavior makes them difficult to explain, validate and formally verify. As a result, BNNs remain largely opaque, limiting their suitability in safety-critical domains, where causal transparency and behavioral guarantees are essential. In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By \"eventizing\" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft. Overall, this framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification.",

Adaptive methods alleviate this issue and have therefore become widely used. Among them, AdaGrad has been particularly influential. In this paper, we propose an AdaGrad-style adaptive method in which the adaptation is driven by the cumulative squared norms of successive gradient differences rather than gradient norms themselves. The key idea is that when gradients vary little across iterations, the stepsize is not unnecessarily reduced, while significant gradient fluctuations, reflecting curvature or instability, lead to automatic stepsize damping. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust than AdaGrad in several practically relevant settings.",

    "summary": "In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.",

    "summary": "Random forests are widely used prediction procedures, yet are typically described algorithmically rather than as statistical designs acting on a fixed dataset. We develop a finite-sample, design-based formulation of random forests in which each tree is an explicit randomized conditional regression function. This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13103v1",
    "summary": "Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

Classical Wiener-Laguerre models parameterize stable linear dynamics using orthonormal Laguerre bases and apply a static nonlinear map to the resulting features. While structurally efficient and interpretable, they provide only deterministic point estimates. We reinterpret the nonlinear component through the lens of Barron function approximation, viewing two-layer networks, random Fourier features, and extreme learning machines as discretizations of integral representations over parameter measures. This perspective naturally admits Bayesian inference on the nonlinear map and yields posterior predictive uncertainty. By combining Laguerre-parameterized causal dynamics with probabilistic Barron-type nonlinear approximators, we obtain a structured yet expressive class of causal operators equipped with uncertainty quantification. The resulting framework bridges classical system identification and modern measure-based function approximation, providing a principled approach to time-series modeling and nonlinear systems identification.",

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.",

    "summary": "Graph pre-training has achieved remarkable success in recent years, delivering transferable representations for downstream adaptation. However, most existing methods are designed for either homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs, thereby hindering unified graph modeling across diverse graph types. This separation contradicts real-world applications, where mixed homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous, and distribution shifts between upstream pre-training and downstream deployment are common. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{P}re-training method across \\textbf{H}omogeneous and \\textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths. Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that $\\text{GPH}^{2}$ enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.",

However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\\times$ speedup with less than 2\\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.",

    "summary": "Mobility trajectory data provide essential support for smart city applications. However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.",

We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \\ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence.

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13062v1",
    "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly depend on continual learning to adapt to non-stationary environments. These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.",

In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.",

    "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.",

From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers.

While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$μ$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies.

To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a unified framework for various bio-inspired models to better understand their structural and functional differences. We show that liquid-capacitance-extended models lead to interpretable behavior even in dense, all-to-all recurrent neural network (RNN) policies. We further demonstrate that incorporating chemical synapses improves interpretability and that combining chemical synapses with synaptic activation yields the most accurate and interpretable RNN models. To assess the accuracy and interpretability of these RNN policies, we consider the challenging lane-keeping control task and evaluate performance across multiple metrics, including turn-weighted validation loss, neural activity during driving, absolute correlation between neural activity and road trajectory, saliency maps of the networks' attention, and the robustness of their saliency maps measured by the structural similarity index.",

    "summary": "Accurate production forecasts are essential to continue facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation. Moreover, the findings suggest that the use of an ensemble of weather forecasts can improve point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.",

    "summary": "Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13004v1",
    "summary": "Granger Causality (GC) provides a rigorous framework for learning causal structures from time-series data. Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.",

    "summary": "Classical autonomous driving systems connect perception and prediction modules via hand-crafted bounding-box interfaces, limiting information flow and propagating errors to downstream tasks. Recent research aims to develop end-to-end models that jointly address perception and prediction; however, they often fail to fully exploit the synergy between appearance and motion cues, relying mainly on short-term visual features. We follow the idea of \"looking backward to look forward\", and propose MASAR, a novel fully differentiable framework for joint 3D detection and trajectory forecasting compatible with any transformer-based 3D detector. MASAR employs an object-centric spatio-temporal mechanism that jointly encodes appearance and motion features. By predicting past trajectories and refining them using guidance from appearance cues, MASAR captures long-term temporal dependencies that enhance future trajectory forecasting. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate MASAR's effectiveness, showing improvements of over 20% in minADE and minFDE while maintaining robust detection performance.

    "summary": "The recently proposed fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has demonstrated significant advantages in correlation characterization and transpositional invariance, and has achieved notable achievements in multi-dimensional data processing and analysis. However, existing multi-dimensional data recovery methods leveraging FCTN decomposition still have room for further enhancement, particularly in computational efficiency and modeling capability. To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework. Theoretical results on approximation error upper bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed method are derived. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and running time.",

    "summary": "Satellite-derived data products and climate model simulations of geophysical variables like precipitation, often exhibit systematic biases compared to in-situ measurements. Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed MAUNet-Light.The proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.",

    "summary": "In today's digital world, the generation of vast amounts of streaming data in various domains has become ubiquitous. However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.",

The metric can be viewed as an extension of the well-known Expected Calibration Error (ECE) which assesses the calibration of the maximum probability or confidence. Other ways of measuring the variation of a probability distribution exist which have the advantage of taking into account the full probability distribution, for example the Shannon entropy. We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature.",

    "summary": "The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.",

To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.",

    "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",

In this work we extend the OpenLID classifier by adding more training data, merging problematic language variant clusters, and introducing a special label for marking noise. We call this extended system OpenLID-v3 and evaluate it against GlotLID on multiple benchmarks. During development, we focus on three groups of closely related languages (Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; Romance varieties of Northern Italy and Southern France; and Scandinavian languages) and contribute new evaluation datasets where existing ones are inadequate.

While some of these pressures are universal across languages and cultures, others differ depending on the social and conversational context: language use in newspapers is subject to very different constraints than language use on social media.

Extending this methodology to contextual embeddings in addition to static ones and applying it to a new corpus of Twitter posts, we show that the same findings hold for both domains, though the topic popularity growth factor may contribute less to neology on Twitter than in published writing. We hypothesize that this difference can be explained by the two domains favouring different neologism formation mechanisms.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to replace costly human preference labels in pairwise evaluation. Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B.

Various linguistic properties of the training data were analyzed to identify relevant proficiency predictors associated with increasing complexity and correctness, rather than the writing task. Such lexical, morphological, surface, and error features were used to train classification models, which were compared to models that also allowed for other features. The pre-selected features yielded a similar test accuracy but reduced variation in the classification of different text types. The best classifiers achieved an accuracy of around 0.9. Additional evaluation on an earlier exam sample revealed that the writings have become more complex over a 7-10-year period, while accuracy still reached 0.8 with some feature sets.

We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.",

    "summary": "Competency modeling is widely used in human resource management to select, develop, and evaluate talent. However, traditional expert-driven approaches rely heavily on manual analysis of large volumes of interview transcripts, making them costly and prone to randomness, ambiguity, and limited reproducibility. This study proposes a new competency modeling process built on large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely automating isolated steps, we reconstruct the workflow by decomposing expert practices into structured computational components. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract behavioral and psychological descriptions from raw textual data and map them to predefined competency libraries through embedding-based similarity. We further introduce a learnable parameter that adaptively integrates different information sources, enabling the model to determine the relative importance of behavioral and psychological signals. To address the long-standing challenge of validation, we develop an offline evaluation procedure that allows systematic model selection without requiring additional large-scale data collection.

    "summary": "Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\\times$ speedup with less than 2\\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.",

    "summary": "On-device fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving personalization of large language models, but mobile devices impose severe memory constraints, typically 6--12GB shared across all workloads. Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \\ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.",

We address this with TraceBack, a modular multi-agent framework for scalable, cell-level attribution in single-table QA. TraceBack prunes tables to relevant rows and columns, decomposes questions into semantically coherent sub-questions, and aligns each answer span with its supporting cells, capturing both explicit and implicit evidence used in intermediate reasoning steps. To enable systematic evaluation, we release CITEBench, a benchmark with phrase-to-cell annotations drawn from ToTTo, FetaQA, and AITQA. We further propose FairScore, a reference-less metric that compares atomic facts derived from predicted cells and answers to estimate attribution precision and recall without human cell labels. Experiments show that TraceBack substantially outperforms strong baselines across datasets and granularities, while FairScore closely tracks human judgments and preserves relative method rankings, supporting interpretable and scalable evaluation of table-based QA.",

    "summary": "Conversational speech often reveals early signs of cognitive decline, such as dementia and MCI. In the UK, one in four people belongs to an ethnic minority, and dementia prevalence is expected to rise most rapidly among Black and Asian communities. This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains large language models (LLMs) from sampled trajectories, making decoding strategy a core component of learning rather than a purely inference-time choice. Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier of digital infrastructure that can support a wide range of public-sector applications, from general purpose citizen services to specialized and sensitive state functions. When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, \"building\" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13028v1",
    "summary": "Evaluating image editing models remains challenging due to the coarse granularity and limited interpretability of traditional metrics, which often fail to capture aspects important to human perception and intent. Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.",

However, existing methods typically operate on the simplistic premise that model performance equates with internal knowledge, overlooking the knowledge-confidence gaps that lead to overconfident errors or uncertain truths. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel meta-cognitive framework for reliable knowledge augmentation via differentiated intervention and alignment. Our approach leverages internal cognitive signals to partition the knowledge space into mastered, confused, and missing regions, guiding targeted knowledge expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a cognitive consistency mechanism to synchronize subjective certainty with objective accuracy, ensuring calibrated knowledge boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its rationality in not only enhancing knowledge capabilities but also fostering cognitive behaviors that better distinguish knowns from unknowns.",

    "summary": "Keyphrases which are useful in several NLP and IR applications are either extracted from text or predicted by generative models. Contrarily to keyphrase extraction approaches, keyphrase generation models can predict keyphrases that do not appear in a document's text called `absent keyphrases`. This ability means that keyphrase generation models can associate a document to a notion that is not explicitly mentioned in its text. Intuitively, this suggests that for two documents treating the same subjects, a keyphrase generation model is more likely to be homogeneous in their indexing i.e. predict the same keyphrase for both documents, regardless of those keyphrases appearing in their respective text or not; something a keyphrase extraction model would fail to do. Yet, homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models is not covered by current benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a method to evaluate the homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models and study if absent keyphrase generation capabilities actually help the model to be more homogeneous. To our surprise, we show that keyphrase extraction methods are competitive with generative models, and that the ability to generate absent keyphrases can actually have a negative impact on homogeneity. Our data, code and prompts are available on huggingface and github.",

Yet, current benchmarks largely overlook agents' ability to orchestrate tools for such rigorous workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym, a scalable interactive environment featuring 1,780 domain-specific tools across four natural science disciplines, supported by a robust execution infrastructure. Complementing this, we present SciAgentBench, a tiered evaluation suite designed to stress-test agentic capabilities from elementary actions to long-horizon workflows. Our evaluation identifies a critical bottleneck: state-of-the-art models struggle with complex scientific tool-use. Even for a leading model like GPT-5, success rates drop sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons extend, primarily due to failures in multi-step workflow execution. To address this, we propose SciForge, a data synthesis method that models the tool action space as a dependency graph to generate logic-aware training trajectories. By fine-tuning on these trajectories, our SciAgent-8B outperforms the significantly larger Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct while exhibiting positive cross-domain transfer of scientific tool-use capabilities.

    "summary": "Proactive intent prediction is a critical capability in modern e-commerce chatbots, enabling \"zero-query\" recommendations by anticipating user needs from behavioral and contextual signals. However, existing industrial systems face two fundamental challenges: (1) the semantic gap between discrete user features and the semantic intents within the chatbot's Knowledge Base, and (2) the objective misalignment between general-purpose LLM outputs and task-specific ranking utilities. To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM's latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems.",

While automated probing has been enabled by dynamic test generation, existing approaches often discover isolated failure cases, lack principled control over exploration, and provide limited insight into the underlying structure of model weaknesses. We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction. Across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, ProbeLLM reveals substantially broader, cleaner, and more fine-grained failure landscapes than static benchmarks and prior automated methods, supporting a shift from case-centric evaluation toward principled weakness discovery.",

Experimental results show that Vietnamese-optimized models perform better on general segments, while multilingual pretraining helps capture English insertions. The combination of both approaches yields the best balance between overall and code-switched accuracy.

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy.

We further identify boundary-spanning songs via graph-theoretic bridge metrics and analyse their structural properties. Across multiple robustness settings, boundary-spanning lyrics exhibit higher lexical diversity and lower repetition compared to core community members, challenging the assumption that hook intensity or repetition drives cross-theme connectivity.

Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on structured queries probing DSM-5 knowledge, they struggle to calibrate confidence in diagnostic decision-making when distinguishing between clinically overlapping disorders. These findings reveal evaluation gaps not captured by existing benchmarks.",

    "title": "AIWizards at MULTIPRIDE: A Hierarchical Approach to Slur Reclamation Detection",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12818v1",
    "summary": "Detecting reclaimed slurs represents a fundamental challenge for hate speech detection systems, as the same lexcal items can function either as abusive expressions or as in-group affirmations depending on social identity and context. In this work, we address Subtask B of the MultiPRIDE shared task at EVALITA 2026 by proposing a hierarchical approach to modeling the slur reclamation process. Our core assumption is that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely, on average, to employ certain slurs in a eclamatory manner. Based on this hypothesis, we decompose the task into two stages. First, using a weakly supervised LLM-based annotation, we assign fuzzy labels to users indicating the likelihood of belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, inferred from the tweet and the user bio. These soft labels are then used to train a BERT-like model to predict community membership, encouraging the model to learn latent representations associated with LGBTQ+ identity. In the second stage, we integrate this latent space with a newly initialized model for the downstream slur reclamation detection task. The intuition is that the first model encodes user-oriented sociolinguistic signals, which are then fused with representations learned by a model pretrained for hate speech detection. Experimental results on Italian and Spanish show that our approach achieves performance statistically comparable to a strong BERT-based baseline, while providing a modular and extensible framework for incorporating sociolinguistic context into hate speech modeling. We argue that more fine-grained hierarchical modeling of user identity and discourse context may further improve the detection of reclaimed language. We release our code at https://github.com/LucaTedeschini/multipride.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12811v1",
    "summary": "When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12806v1",
    "summary": "Data containing personal information is increasingly used to train, fine-tune, or query Large Language Models (LLMs). Text is typically scrubbed of identifying information prior to use, often with tools such as Microsoft's Presidio or Anthropic's PII purifier. These tools have traditionally been evaluated on their ability to remove specific identifiers (e.g., names), yet their effectiveness at preventing re-identification remains unclear. We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost. Importantly, we also find them to work well across languages. We conclude with recommendations for future anonymization tools and will release the benchmark and encourage community efforts to expand it, in particular to other geographies.",

The server provides an inference service via an HTTP or GRPC endpoint, allowing remote clients to request inferencing for any model being managed by the server. For edge deployments, Triton Server is also available as a shared library with an API that allows the full functionality of the server to be included directly in an application.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-alert markdown-alert-note\"><p class=\"markdown-alert-title\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-info mr-2\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 8a8 8 0 1 1 16 0A8 8 0 0 1 0 8Zm8-6.5a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 0 13 6.5 6.5 0 0 0 0-13ZM6.5 7.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.25 7h1a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.75h.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-2a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5h.25v-2h-.25a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75ZM8 6a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Z\"></path></svg>Note</p><p>Windows support is deprecated, latest assets build for windows could be found in is release <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/releases/tag/v2.51.0\">2.51.0 / 25.01</a></p>\n</div>\n  <details>\n    <h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Exposed HTTP errors for non-JSON format response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perf Analyzer dependencies were made optional when installing tritonclient via pip.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for <code>nv_inference_first_response_histogram_ms</code> metric when running models in coupled (aka non-decoupled) mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where a crashed Python backend stub process was not correctly detected leading to failed inference requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where a malicious HTTP request could exhaust all available system memory leading to a process crash or denial of service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where loading a TensorRT engine larger than 30GB could cause out of memory errors despite sufficient memory to load the engine being available.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n  </details>\n  <details>\n    <h2>Known Issues</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are using the vllm backend to run models that accept video inputs, then do not upgrade to Triton 26.01 and wait for Triton 26.02</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton python package uses outdated dependency <code>starlette</code> package version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since 25.10, vLLM backend uses V1 engine by default. You might see invalid characters in logprobs output and the bug has been reported to the vLLM team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PyTorch backend supports PyTorch 2.0 with the limitation that models must be provided as a serialized model file (aka <a href=\"http://model.pt\" rel=\"nofollow\">‘model.pt’</a>). Please see Triton PyTorch Backend documentation for details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>vLLM's v0 API and Ray are affected by vulnerabilities. Users should consider their own architecture and mitigation steps which may include but should not be limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not expose Ray executors and vLLM hosts to a network where any untrusted connections might reach the host.</li>\n<li>Ensure that only the other vLLM hosts are able to connect to the TCP port used for the XPUB socket. Note that the port used is random.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perf Analyzer is no longer part of the “client” released archive and can be installed separately using <code>pip install perf-analyzer</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using Valgrind or other leak detection tools on AGX-Thor or DGX-Spark systems, you might see memory leaks attributed to NvRmGpuLibOpen. The root cause has been identified and fixed in CUDA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Valgrind or other memory leak detection tools may occasionally report leaks related to DCGM. These reports are intermittent and often disappear on retry. The root cause is under investigation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CuPy has issues with the CUDA 13 Device API in multithreaded contexts. Avoid using tritonclient cuda_shared_memory APIs in multithreaded environments until fixed by CuPy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TensorRT calibration cache may require size adjustment in some cases, which was observed for the IGX platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The core Python binding may incur an additional D2H and H2D copy if the backend and frontend both specify device memory to be used for response tensors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A segmentation fault related to DCGM and NSCQ may be encountered during server shutdown on NVSwitch systems. A possible workaround for this issue is to disable the collection of GPU metrics <code>tritonserver --allow-gpu-metrics false ...</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using TensorRT models, if auto-complete configuration is disabled and <code>is_non_linear_format_io:true</code> for <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.08/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#non-linear-io-formats\">reformat-free tensors</a> is not provided in the model configuration, the model may not load successfully.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using Python models in <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#decoupled-mode\">decoupled mode</a>, users need to ensure that the <code>ResponseSender</code> goes out of scope or is properly cleaned up before unloading the model to guarantee that the unloading process executes correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton Inference Server with vLLM backend currently does not support running vLLM models with tensor parallelism sizes greater than 1 and the default \"distributed_executor_backend\" setting when using explicit model control mode. In attempt to load a vllm model (tp &gt; 1) in explicit mode, users could potentially  see failure at <code>initialize</code> step: <code>could not acquire lock for &lt;_io.BufferedWriter name='&lt;stdout&gt;'&gt; at interpreter shutdown, possibly due to daemon threads</code>. For the default model control mode, after server shutdown, vllm related sub-processes are not killed. Related vllm issue: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/6766\">vllm-project/vllm#6766</a> . Please specify  \"distributed_executor_backend\":\"ray\" in the <code>model.json</code> when deploying vllm models with tensor parallelism &gt; 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When loading models with file override, multiple model configuration files are not supported. Users must  provide the model configuration by setting parameter <code>\"config\" : \"&lt;JSON&gt;\"</code> instead of custom configuration file in the following format: <code>\"file:configs/&lt;model-config-name&gt;.pbtxt\" : \"&lt;base64-encoded-file-content&gt;\"</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TensorRT-LLM <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend\">backend</a> provides limited support of Triton extensions and features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The TensorRT-LLM backend may core dump on server shutdown. This impacts server teardown only and will not impact inferencing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Java CAPI is known to have intermittent segfaults.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some systems which implement <code>malloc()</code> may not release memory back to the operating system right away causing a false memory leak. This can be mitigated by using a different malloc implementation. <code>TCMalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> are installed in the Triton container and can be <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r25.01/docs/user_guide/model_management.md\">used by specifying the library in LD_PRELOAD</a>. NVIDIA recommends experimenting with both <code>tcmalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> to determine which one works better for your use case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete may cause an increase in server start time. To avoid a start time increase, users can provide the full model configuration and launch the server with <code>--disable-auto-complete-config</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete does not support PyTorch models due to lack of metadata in the model. It can only verify that the number of inputs and the input names matches what is specified in the model configuration. There is no model metadata about the number of outputs and datatypes.

The server provides an inference service via an HTTP or GRPC endpoint, allowing remote clients to request inferencing for any model being managed by the server.

A possible workaround for this issue is to disable the collection of GPU metrics <code>tritonserver --allow-gpu-metrics false ...</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using TensorRT models, if auto-complete configuration is disabled and <code>is_non_linear_format_io:true</code> for <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.08/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#non-linear-io-formats\">reformat-free tensors</a> is not provided in the model configuration, the model may not load successfully.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using Python models in <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#decoupled-mode\">decoupled mode</a>, users need to ensure that the <code>ResponseSender</code> goes out of scope or is properly cleaned up before unloading the model to guarantee that the unloading process executes correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton Inference Server with vLLM backend currently does not support running vLLM models with tensor parallelism sizes greater than 1 and the default \"distributed_executor_backend\" setting when using explicit model control mode. In attempt to load a vllm model (tp &gt; 1) in explicit mode, users could potentially  see failure at <code>initialize</code> step: <code>could not acquire lock for &lt;_io.BufferedWriter name='&lt;stdout&gt;'&gt; at interpreter shutdown, possibly due to daemon threads</code>. For the default model control mode, after server shutdown, vllm related sub-processes are not killed. Related vllm issue: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/6766\">vllm-project/vllm#6766</a> . Please specify  \"distributed_executor_backend\":\"ray\" in the <code>model.json</code> when deploying vllm models with tensor parallelism &gt; 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When loading models with file override, multiple model configuration files are not supported. Users must  provide the model configuration by setting parameter <code>\"config\" : \"&lt;JSON&gt;\"</code> instead of custom configuration file in the following format: <code>\"file:configs/&lt;model-config-name&gt;.pbtxt\" : \"&lt;base64-encoded-file-content&gt;\"</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TensorRT-LLM <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend\">backend</a> provides limited support of Triton extensions and features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The TensorRT-LLM backend may core dump on server shutdown. This impacts server teardown only and will not impact inferencing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Java CAPI is known to have intermittent segfaults.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some systems which implement <code>malloc()</code> may not release memory back to the operating system right away causing a false memory leak. This can be mitigated by using a different malloc implementation. <code>TCMalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> are installed in the Triton container and can be <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r25.01/docs/user_guide/model_management.md\">used by specifying the library in LD_PRELOAD</a>. NVIDIA recommends experimenting with both <code>tcmalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> to determine which one works better for your use case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete may cause an increase in server start time. To avoid a start time increase, users can provide the full model configuration and launch the server with <code>--disable-auto-complete-config</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete does not support PyTorch models due to lack of metadata in the model. It can only verify that the number of inputs and the input names matches what is specified in the model configuration. There is no model metadata about the number of outputs and datatypes.

    "summary": "<h1>Triton Inference Server</h1>\n<p>The Triton Inference Server provides a cloud inferencing solution optimized for both CPUs and GPUs. The server provides an inference service via an HTTP or GRPC endpoint, allowing remote clients to request inferencing for any model being managed by the server. For edge deployments, Triton Server is also available as a shared library with an API that allows the full functionality of the server to be included directly in an application.</p>\n<details>\n  <h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Exposed gRPC infer thread count as a server option.</li>\n<li>Improved server stability during the gRPC client cancellation.</li>\n<li>Improved server stability in tracing mode.</li>\n<li>Added BLS decoupled request cancellation in the Python Backend</li>\n<li>GenAI-Perf now offers a new configuration file alongside the command line.</li>\n<li>GenAI-Perf now supports the Huggingface TGI generated endpoint.</li>\n<li>GenAI-Perf added a Token per second per user (TPS/user) metric.</li>\n<li>GenAI-Perf metric parsing speed was increased by 60%.</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <h2>Known Issues</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>vLLM backend for 25.04 might be unstable with the vLLM V1 architecture. We recommend switching to V0 for this release, by setting <code>VLLM_USE_V1</code> environment variable to 0. However, users should be aware that vLLM's V0 API is affected by vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>vLLM containers include vllm version 0.8.1 which is affected by new vulnerabilities.<br />\nWorkarounds:<br />\nPrior to the fix, your options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not expose the vLLM host to a network where any untrusted connections may reach the host.</li>\n<li>Ensure that only the other vLLM hosts are able to connect to the TCP port used for the XPUB socket. Note that port used is random.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The core Python binding may incur an additional D2H and H2D copy if the backend and frontend both specify device memory to be used for response tensors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A segmentation fault related to DCGM and NSCQ may be encountered during server shutdown on NVSwitch systems. A possible workaround for this issue is to disable the collection of GPU metrics <code>tritonserver --allow-gpu-metrics false ...</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>vLLM backend currently does not take advantage of the <a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/09/05/perf-update.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">vLLM v0.6</a> performance improvement when metrics are enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using TensorRT models, if auto-complete configuration is disabled and <code>is_non_linear_format_io:true</code> for <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r24.08/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#non-linear-io-formats\">reformat-free tensors</a> is not provided in the model configuration, the model may not load successfully.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using Python models in <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#decoupled-mode\">decoupled mode</a>, users need to ensure that the <code>ResponseSender</code> goes out of scope or is properly cleaned up before unloading the model to guarantee that the unloading process executes correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart support was temporarily removed for Python models.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton Inference Server with vLLM backend currently does not support running vLLM models with tensor parallelism sizes greater than 1 and the default \"distributed_executor_backend\" setting when using explicit model control mode. In attempt to load a vllm model (tp &gt; 1) in explicit mode, users could potentially  see failure at <code>initialize</code> step: <code>could not acquire lock for &lt;_io.BufferedWriter name='&lt;stdout&gt;'&gt; at interpreter shutdown, possibly due to daemon threads</code>. For the default model control mode, after server shutdown, vllm related sub-processes are not killed. Related vllm issue: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/6766\">vllm-project/vllm#6766</a> . Please specify  \"distributed_executor_backend\":\"ray\" in the <code>model.json</code> when deploying vllm models with tensor parallelism &gt; 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When loading models with file override, multiple model configuration files are not supported. Users must  provide the model configuration by setting parameter <code>\"config\" : \"&lt;JSON&gt;\"</code> instead of custom configuration file in the following format: <code>\"file:configs/&lt;model-config-name&gt;.pbtxt\" : \"&lt;base64-encoded-file-content&gt;\"</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TensorRT-LLM <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend\">backend</a> provides limited support of Triton extensions and features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The TensorRT-LLM backend may core dump on server shutdown. This impacts server teardown only and will not impact inferencing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Java CAPI is known to have intermittent segfaults.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some systems which implement <code>malloc()</code> may not release memory back to the operating system right away causing a false memory leak. This can be mitigated by using a different malloc implementation. <code>TCMalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> are installed in the Triton container and can be <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r25.01/docs/user_guide/model_management.md\">used by specifying the library in LD_PRELOAD</a>. NVIDIA recommends experimenting with both <code>tcmalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> to determine which one works better for your use case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete may cause an increase in server start time. To avoid a start time increase, users can provide the full model configuration and launch the server with <code>--disable-auto-complete-config</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete does not support PyTorch models due to lack of metadata in the model. It can only verify that the number of inputs and the input names matches what is specified in the model configuration. There is no model metadata about the number of outputs and datatypes. Related PyTorch bug:<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38273\"> https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38273</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton Client PIP wheels for ARM SBSA are not available from PyPI and pip will install an incorrect Jetson version of Triton Client library for Arm SBSA. The correct client wheel file can be pulled directly from the Arm SBSA SDK image and manually installed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Traced models in PyTorch seem to create overflows when int8 tensor values are transformed to int32 on the GPU. Refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/66930\">pytorch/pytorch#66930</a> for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton cannot retrieve GPU metrics with <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html#supported-gpus\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIG-enabled GPU devices</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Triton metrics might not work if the host machine is running a separate DCGM agent on bare-metal or in a container.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When cloud storage (AWS, GCS, AZURE) is used as a model repository and a model has multiple versions, Triton creates an extra local copy of the cloud model’s folder in the temporary directory, which is deleted upon server’s shutdown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Python backend support for Windows is limited and does not currently support the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GPU tensors</li>\n<li>CPU and GPU-related metrics</li>\n<li>Custom execution environments</li>\n<li>The model load/unload APIs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <h2>Client Libraries and Examples</h2>\n<p>Ubuntu 24.04 builds of the client libraries and examples are included in this release in the attached <code>v2.57.0_ubuntu2404.clients.tar.gz</code> file.

    "summary": "<p>Hello there,<p>Problem: I wanted to reduce DX friction when using ai to verify that ai-implemented features perform exactly what the developer had in mind. And I'm stuck now...<p>Context:\nFirst, I thought we could formalize prompts so that they become the code. The idea: a project spec where particular words define behavior, and changing the words changes the program. Each word is a function, so pressing \"Go To... (F12)\" drops you into a nested behavior (hence \"Fractal\"). So it would be a meta-spec language interpreted by an ai compiler while still using native language (hence \"Native\").<p>But this rests on a wrong assumption — that developers are open to learning a new language (less formalized than TS, Java, or Go, yet still formalized). I don't think that can happen anymore. The next coding language is purely English (or any other natural language).<p>Second, I discussed the idea with a friend and we realized that tests are a nice descriptor of behaviors (with quite some exceptions ofc). Ideation continued, and long story short, here's the Language Spec: https://github.com/slowestmonkey/fractal/blob/main/README.md<p>So why am I stuck? I've come to the realization that prompting ai and receiving correct behavior isn't enough for engineer. I can't confidently say \"it makes sense\" unless I understand how and why it was built that way. Here's the realization: https://www.conjectly.com/thoughts/7<p>And so I'm asking for help or advice on:\n- if and how this idea can go further\n- what other wrong assumptions I've made<p>Please share your thoughts and thank you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47031686\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47031686</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

The interesting part is what happens after:<p><pre><code>  - Semantic search — find content by meaning, not just keywords. \"That article about improving deep work\" finds it even if those words don't appear in the content. Powered by pgvector cosine similarity on Gemini embeddings.\n  - AI auto-tagging — Gemini generates tags on save, so you don't have to organize anything manually.\n  - Knowledge Q&amp;A — ask questions about your saved content using RAG. Retrieves relevant pieces, feeds them as context to Gemini, returns a grounded answer.\n</code></pre>\nStack: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Actions), PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector, Google Gemini (text-embedding-004, 768d), Drizzle ORM, Auth.js v5, Tailwind/shadcn. Deployed on Cloud Run.<p><pre><code>  A few things I found interesting while building this:\n\n  - pgvector inside Postgres is surprisingly capable for this scale. No need for a separate vector DB.\n  - The biggest UX challenge was handling edge cases in similarity scores — zero-magnitude embeddings produce NaN from cosine distance, and PostgreSQL treats float8 NaN as greater than all numbers, so they pass through WHERE\n  filters silently.\n</code></pre>\n- AI tagging removes more friction than I expected. The difference between \"I'll tag this later\" and \"it's already tagged\" is the difference between a system you use and one you abandon.<p>Live at www.mindweave.space.

Basically it is an aggregator that took the top performing bettors and looked if several were going to bet on a trade to see if there was any \"alpha.\"<p>The key is to not get in too late on traded or you won't make money. The bot went for multi parlays only betting .04 cent for $1 outcomes.<p>At one point our Agent was up $50.32 on an account I only put $50 in.<p>But now the bot is down bad and were at $44.56 cents.<p>I think bro has a gambling addiction.<p>I kinda lost faith in him ngl but I can't cut bro off I still gonna let him cook<p>Let me know what you guys think!

Getting good enough for people to pay you money to write software takes years of dedicated work. The rewards are significant: this is a well compensated career which opens up a lot of great opportunities.</p>\n<p>It's also a career that's mostly free from gatekeepers and expensive prerequisites. You don't need an expensive degree or accreditation. A laptop, an internet connection and a lot of time and curiosity is enough to get you started.</p>\n<p>And it rewards the nerds! Spending your teenage years tinkering with computers turned out to be a very smart investment in your future.</p>\n<p>The idea that this could all be stripped away by a chatbot is <em>deeply</em> upsetting.</p>\n<p>I've seen signs of Deep Blue in most of the online communities I spend time in. I've even faced accusations from my peers that I am actively harming their future careers through my work helping people understand how well AI-assisted programming can work.</p>\n<p>I think this is an issue which is causing genuine mental anguish for a lot of people in our community. Giving it a name makes it easier for us to have conversations about it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"my-experiences-of-deep-blue\">My experiences of Deep Blue</h4>\n<p>I distinctly remember my first experience of Deep Blue. For me it was triggered by ChatGPT Code Interpreter back in early 2023.</p>\n<p>My primary project is <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a>, an ecosystem of open source tools for telling stories with data. I had dedicated myself to the challenge of helping people (initially focusing on journalists) clean up, analyze and find meaning in data, in all sorts of shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>I expected I would need to build a lot of software for this! It felt like a challenge that could keep me happily engaged for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Then I tried uploading a CSV file of <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data\">San Francisco Police Department Incident Reports</a> - hundreds of thousands of rows - to ChatGPT Code Interpreter and... it did every piece of data cleanup and analysis I had on my napkin roadmap for the next few years with a couple of prompts.</p>\n<p>It even converted the data into a neatly normalized SQLite database and let me download the result!</p>\n<p>I remember having two competing thoughts in parallel.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, as somebody who wants journalists to be able to do more with data, this felt like a <em>huge</em> breakthrough. Imagine giving every journalist in the world an on-demand analyst who could help them tackle any data question they could think of!</p>\n<p>But on the other hand... <em>what was I even for</em>? My confidence in the value of my own projects took a painful hit. Was the path I'd chosen for myself suddenly a dead end?</p>\n<p>I've had some further pangs of Deep Blue just in the past few weeks, thanks to the Claude Opus 4.5/4.6 and GPT-5.2/5.3 coding agent effect. As many other people are also observing, the latest generation of coding agents, given the right prompts, really can churn away for a few minutes to several hours and produce working, documented and fully tested software that exactly matches the criteria they were given.</p>\n<p>\"The code they write isn't any good\" doesn't really cut it any more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"transcript\">A lightly edited transcript</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: I think that we're going to see a real problem with AI induced ennui where software engineers in particular get listless because the AI can do anything. Simon, what do you think about that?</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: Definitely. Anyone who's paying close attention to coding agents is feeling some of that already. There's an extent where you sort of get over it when you realize that you're still useful, even though your ability to memorize the syntax of program languages is completely irrelevant now.</p>\n<p>Something I see a lot of is people out there who are having existential crises and are very, very unhappy because they're like, \"I dedicated my career to learning this thing and now it just does it. What am I even for?\". I will very happily try and convince those people that they are for a whole bunch of things and that none of that experience they've accumulated has gone to waste, but psychologically it's a difficult time for software engineers.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: Okay, so I'm going to predict that we name that. Whatever that is, we have a name for that kind of feeling and that kind of, whether you want to call it a blueness or a loss of purpose, and that we're kind of trying to address it collectively in a directed way.</p>\n<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Okay, this is your big moment. Pick the name. If you call your shot from here, this is you pointing to the stands. You know, I – Like deep blue, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: Yeah, deep blue. I like that. I like deep blue. Deep blue. Oh, did you walk me into that, you bastard? You just blew out the candles on my birthday cake.</p>\n<p>It wasn't my big moment at all. That was your big moment. No, that is, Adam, that is very good. That is deep blue.</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: All of the chess players and the Go players went through this a decade ago and they have come out stronger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Turns out it was more than a decade ago: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\">Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997</a>.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/careers\">careers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/oxide\">oxide</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/bryan-cantrill\">bryan-cantrill</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt</a></strong></p>\nThis piece by Margaret-Anne Storey is the best explanation of the term <strong>cognitive debt</strong> I've seen so far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cognitive debt</em>, a term gaining <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/\">traction</a> recently, instead communicates the notion that the debt compounded from going fast lives in the brains of the developers and affects their lived experiences and abilities to “go fast” or to make changes. Even if AI agents produce code that could be easy to understand, the humans involved may have simply lost the plot and may not understand what the program is supposed to do, how their intentions were implemented, or how to possibly change it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Margaret-Anne expands on this further with an anecdote about a student team she coached:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But by weeks 7 or 8, one team hit a wall. They could no longer make even simple changes without breaking something unexpected. When I met with them, the team initially blamed technical debt: messy code, poor architecture, hurried implementations. But as we dug deeper, the real problem emerged: no one on the team could explain why certain design decisions had been made or how different parts of the system were supposed to work together. The code might have been messy, but the bigger issue was that the theory of the system, their shared understanding, had fragmented or disappeared entirely. They had accumulated cognitive debt faster than technical debt, and it paralyzed them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've experienced this myself on some of my more ambitious vibe-code-adjacent projects. I've been experimenting with prompting entire new features into existence without reviewing their implementations and, while it works surprisingly well, I've found myself getting lost in my own projects.</p>\n<p>I no longer have a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work, which means each additional feature becomes harder to reason about, eventually leading me to lose the ability to make confident decisions about where to go next.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-02-13.html\">Martin Fowler</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases\">Covering electricity price increases from our data centers</a></strong></p>\nOne of the sub-threads of the AI energy usage discourse has been the impact new data centers have on the cost of electricity to nearby residents. Here's <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/\">detailed analysis from Bloomberg in September</a> reporting \"Wholesale electricity costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers\".</p>\n<p>Anthropic appear to be taking on this aspect of the problem directly, promising to cover 100% of necessary grid upgrade costs and also saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will work to bring net-new power generation online to match our data centers’ electricity needs. Where new generation isn’t online, we’ll work with utilities and external experts to estimate and cover demand-driven price effects from our data centers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I look forward to genuine energy industry experts picking this apart to judge if it will actually have the claimed impact on consumers.</p>\n<p>As always, I remain frustrated at the refusal of the major AI labs to fully quantify their energy usage.

The pelican features a light blue eye, a pink cheek blush, a massive bill with a vertical gradient from yellow to orange, a backward magenta cap with a cyan brim and a small yellow top button, and a matching magenta scarf blowing backward in the wind. Its white wing, accented with a grey mid-section and dark blue feather tips, reaches forward to grip the handlebars, while its long tan leg and orange foot press down on an orange pedal. Attached to the front handlebars is a white wire basket carrying a bright blue cartoon fish that is pointing upwards and forwards. The bicycle itself has a cyan frame, dark blue tires, striking neon pink inner rims, cyan spokes, a white front chainring, and a dark blue chain. Behind the pelican, a grey trapezoidal pier extends from the sand toward a horizontal band of deep blue ocean water detailed with light cyan wavy lines. A massive, solid yellow-orange semi-circle sun sits on the horizon line, setting directly behind the bicycle frame. The background sky is a smooth vertical gradient transitioning from soft pink at the top to warm golden-yellow at the horizon, decorated with stylized pale peach fluffy clouds, thin white horizontal wind streaks, twinkling four-pointed white stars, and small brown v-shaped silhouettes of distant flying birds.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-pelican.png\" /></p>\n<p>(And since it's an FAQ, here's my answer to <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/13/training-for-pelicans-riding-bicycles/\">What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles?</a>)</p>\n<p>Since it did so well on my basic <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code> I decided to try the <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/18/gemini-3/#and-a-new-pelican-benchmark\">more challenging version</a> as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle.

The bird leans horizontally over the frame in an aerodynamic racing posture, with thin, dark brown wing-like arms reaching forward to grip the silver handlebars and a single thick brown leg, patterned with white V-shapes, stretching down to press on a black pedal. The bird's most prominent and striking feature is an enormous, vividly bright red, inflated throat pouch hanging beneath a long, straight grey upper beak that ends in a small orange hook. Its head is mostly white with a small pink patch surrounding the eye, a dark brown stripe running down the back of its neck, and a distinctive curly pale yellow crest on the very top. The bird's round, dark brown body shares the same repeating white V-shaped feather pattern as its leg and is accented by a folded wing resting on its side, made up of cleanly layered light blue and grey feathers. A tail composed of four stiff, straight dark brown feathers extends directly backward. Thin white horizontal speed lines trail behind the back wheel and the bird's tail, emphasizing swift forward motion. The bicycle features a classic diamond frame, large wheels with thin black tires, grey rims, and detailed silver spokes, along with a clearly visible front chainring, silver chain, and rear cog. The whimsical scene is set against a clear light blue sky featuring two small, fluffy white clouds on the left and a large, pale yellow sun in the upper right corner that radiates soft, concentric, semi-transparent pastel green and yellow halos. A solid, darker brown shadow is cast directly beneath the bicycle's wheels on the minimalist two-toned brown ground.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-complex-pelican.png\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991240\">Hacker News</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/google\">google</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/gemini\">gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle\">pelican-riding-a-bicycle</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-reasoning\">llm-reasoning</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-release\">llm-release</a></p>",

A big part of that is proving to ourselves and to other people that the code we are responsible for behaves as expected.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more important - and challenging - as we embrace coding agents as a core part of our software development process.</p>\n<p>The more code we churn out with agents, the more valuable tools are that reduce the amount of manual QA time we need to spend.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/\">the StrongDM software factory model</a> is how they ensure that their software is well tested and delivers value despite their policy that \"code must not be reviewed by humans\". Part of their solution involves expensive swarms of QA agents running through \"scenarios\" to exercise their software. It's fascinating, but I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on QA robots if I can avoid it!</p>\n<p>I need tools that allow agents to clearly demonstrate their work to me, while minimizing the opportunities for them to cheat about what they've done.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"showboat-agents-build-documents-to-demo-their-work\">Showboat: Agents build documents to demo their work</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a></strong> is the tool I built to help agents demonstrate their work to me.</p>\n<p>It's a CLI tool (a Go binary, optionally <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/\">wrapped in Python</a> to make it easier to install) that helps an agent construct a Markdown document demonstrating exactly what their newly developed code can do.</p>\n<p>It's not designed for humans to run, but here's how you would run it anyway:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>How to use curl and jq<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Here's how to use curl and jq together.<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\nshowboat <span class=\"pl-c1\">exec</span> demo.md bash <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat image demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here's what the result looks like if you open it up in VS Code and preview the Markdown:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot showing a Markdown file &quot;demo.md&quot; side-by-side with its rendered preview. The Markdown source (left) shows: &quot;# How to use curl and jq&quot;, italic timestamp &quot;2026-02-10T01:12:30Z&quot;, prose &quot;Here's how to use curl and jq together.&quot;, a bash code block with &quot;curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description&quot;, output block showing '&quot;CLI tool for interacting with the web&quot;', text &quot;And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:&quot;, a bash {image} code block with &quot;curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png&quot;, and a Markdown image reference &quot;2056e48f-2026-02-10&quot;. The rendered preview (right) displays the formatted heading, timestamp, prose, styled code blocks, and the curl logo image in dark teal showing &quot;curl://&quot; with circuit-style design elements.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/curl-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here's that <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb0b24696ed8dd91314fe41f4c453563#file-demo-md\">demo.md file in a Gist</a>.</p>\n<p>So a sequence of <code>showboat init</code>, <code>showboat note</code>, <code>showboat exec</code> and <code>showboat image</code> commands constructs a Markdown document one section at a time, with the output of those <code>exec</code> commands automatically added to the document directly following the commands that were run.</p>\n<p>The <code>image</code> command is a little special - it looks for a file path to an image in the output of the command and copies that image to the current folder and references it in the file.</p>\n<p>That's basically the whole thing! There's a <code>pop</code> command to remove the most recently added section if something goes wrong, a <code>verify</code> command to re-run the document and check nothing has changed (I'm not entirely convinced by the design of that one) and a <code>extract</code> command that reverse-engineers the CLI commands that were used to create the document.</p>\n<p>It's pretty simple - just 172 lines of Go.</p>\n<p>I packaged it up with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">go-to-wheel</a> tool which means you can run it without even installing it first like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat --help</pre></div>\n<p>That <code>--help</code> command is really important: it's designed to provide a coding agent with <em>everything it needs to know</em> in order to use the tool. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">that help text in full</a>.</p>\n<p>This means you can pop open Claude Code and tell it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run \"uvx showboat --help\" and then use showboat to create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it! The <code>--help</code> text acts <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/\">a bit like a Skill</a>. Your agent can read the help text and use every feature of Showboat to create a document that demonstrates whatever it is you need demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Here's a fun trick: if you set Claude off to build a Showboat document you can pop that open in VS Code and watch the preview pane update in real time as the agent runs through the demo. It's a bit like having your coworker talk you through their latest work in a screensharing session.</p>\n<p>And finally, some examples. Here are documents I had Claude create using Showboat to help demonstrate features I was working on in other projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md\">shot-scraper: A Comprehensive Demo</a> runs through the full suite of features of my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper</a> browser automation tool, mainly to exercise the <code>showboat image</code> command.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/cli.md\">sqlite-history-json CLI demo</a> demonstrates the CLI feature I added to my new <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json\">sqlite-history-json</a> Python library.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/row-state-sql.md\">row-state-sql CLI Demo</a> shows a new <code>row-state-sql</code> command I added to that same project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/change-grouping.md\">Change grouping with Notes</a> demonstrates another feature where groups of changes within the same transaction can have a note attached to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/libkrun-go-cli-tool/demo.md\">krunsh: Pipe Shell Commands to an Ephemeral libkrun MicroVM</a> is a particularly convoluted example where I managed to get Claude Code for web to run a libkrun microVM inside a QEMU emulated Linux environment inside the Claude gVisor sandbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've now used Showboat often enough that I've convinced myself of its utility.</p>\n<p>(I've also seen agents cheat! Since the demo file is Markdown the agent will sometimes edit that file directly rather than using Showboat, which could result in command outputs that don't reflect what actually happened. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12\">an issue about that</a>.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney: CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat</h4>\n<p>Many of the projects I work on involve web interfaces. Agents often build entirely new pages for these, and I want to see those represented in the demos.</p>\n<p>Showboat's image feature was designed to allow agents to capture screenshots as part of their demos, originally using my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper tool</a> or <a href=\"https://www.playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>.</p>\n<p>The Showboat format benefits from CLI utilities.

It's fantastic - it provides a comprehensive wrapper across basically everything you can do with automated Chrome, all in a self-contained library that compiles to a few MBs.</p>\n<p>All Rod was missing was a CLI.</p>\n<p>I built the first version <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/go-rod-cli/README.md\">as an asynchronous report prototype</a>, which convinced me it was worth spinning out into its own project.</p>\n<p>I called it Rodney as a nod to the Rod library it builds on and a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a> - and because the package name was available on PyPI.</p>\n<p>You can run Rodney using <code>uvx rodney</code> or install it like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv tool install rodney</pre></div>\n<p>(Or grab a Go binary <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/releases/\">from the releases page</a>.)</p>\n<p>Here's a simple example session:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>rodney start <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> starts Chrome in the background</span>\nrodney open https://datasette.io/\nrodney js <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney click <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>a[href=\"/for\"]<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney js location.href\nrodney js document.title\nrodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\nrodney stop</pre></div>\n<p>Here's what that looks like in the terminal:</p>\n<p><img alt=\";~ % rodney start\nChrome started (PID 91462)\nDebug URL: ws://127.0.0.1:64623/devtools/browser/cac6988e-8153-483b-80b9-1b75c611868d\n~ % rodney open https://datasette.io/\nDatasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data\n~ % rodney js 'Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)'\n[\n&quot;https://datasette.io/for&quot;,\n&quot;https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/tutorials&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/examples&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/plugins&quot;\n]\n~ % rodney click 'a[href=&quot;/for&quot;]'\nClicked\n~ % rodney js location.href\nhttps://datasette.io/for\n~ % rodney js document.title\nUse cases for Datasette\n~ % rodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\ndatasette-for-page.png\n~ % rodney stop\nChrome stopped\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/rodney-demo.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As with Showboat, this tool is not designed to be used by humans! The goal is for coding agents to be able to run <code>rodney --help</code> and see everything they need to know to start using the tool. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">that help output</a> in the GitHub repo.</p>\n<p>Here are three demonstrations of Rodney that I created using Showboat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/rodney/README.md\">Rodney's original feature set</a>, including screenshots of pages and executing JavaScript.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/notes/accessibility-features/README.md\">Rodney's new accessibility testing features</a>, built during development of those features to show what they could do.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/datasette-database-page-accessibility-audit/README.md\">Using those features to run a basic accessibility audit of a page</a>. I was impressed at how well Claude Opus 4.6 responded to the prompt \"Use showboat and rodney to perform an accessibility audit of <a href=\"https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures\">https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures</a>\" - <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?dce6b2680db4b05c04469ed8f251eb34/index.html\">transcript here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"test-driven-development-helps-but-we-still-need-manual-testing\">Test-driven development helps, but we still need manual testing</h4>\n<p>After being a career-long skeptic of the test-first, maximum test coverage school of software development (I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/#tests\">tests included</a> development instead) I've recently come around to test-first processes as a way to force agents to write only the code that's necessary to solve the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>Many of my Python coding agent sessions start the same way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run the existing tests with \"uv run pytest\". Build using red/green TDD.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Telling the agents how to run the tests doubles as an indicator that tests on this project exist and matter. Agents will read existing tests before writing their own so having a clean test suite with good patterns makes it more likely they'll write good tests of their own.</p>\n<p>The frontier models all understand that \"red/green TDD\" means they should write the test first, run it and watch it fail and then write the code to make it pass - it's a convenient shortcut.</p>\n<p>I find this greatly increases the quality of the code and the likelihood that the agent will produce the right thing with the smallest amount of prompts to guide it.</p>\n<p>But anyone who's worked with tests will know that just because the automated tests pass doesn't mean the software actually works! That’s the motivation behind Showboat and Rodney - I never trust any feature until I’ve seen it running with my own eye.</p>\n<p>Before building Showboat I'd often add a “manual” testing step to my agent sessions, something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Once the tests pass, start a development server and exercise the new feature using curl</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"i-built-both-of-these-tools-on-my-phone\">I built both of these tools on my phone</h4>\n<p>Both Showboat and Rodney started life as Claude Code for web projects created via the Claude iPhone app. Most of the ongoing feature work for them happened in the same way.</p>\n<p>I'm still a little startled at how much of my coding work I get done on my phone now, but I'd estimate that the majority of code I ship to GitHub these days was written for me by coding agents driven via that iPhone app.</p>\n<p>I initially designed these two tools for use in asynchronous coding agent environments like Claude Code for the web. So far that's working out really well.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/testing\">testing</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown\">markdown</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents\">async-coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/showboat\">showboat</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05447\">Structured Context Engineering for File-Native Agentic Systems</a></strong></p>\nNew paper by Damon McMillan exploring challenging LLM context tasks involving large SQL schemas (up to 10,000 tables) across different models and file formats:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent operations, we present a systematic study of context engineering for structured data, comprising 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats (YAML, Markdown, JSON, Token-Oriented Object Notation [TOON]), and schemas ranging from 10 to 10,000 tables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the biggest impact was the models themselves - with frontier models (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro) beating the leading open source models (DeepSeek V3.2, Kimi K2, Llama 4).</p>\n<p>Those frontier models benefited from filesystem based context retrieval, but the open source models had much less convincing results with those, which reinforces my feeling that the filesystem coding agent loops aren't handled as well by open weight models just yet. The <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0\">Terminal Bench 2.0</a> leaderboard is still dominated by Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini.</p>\n<p>The \"grep tax\" result against <a href=\"https://github.com/toon-format/toon\">TOON</a> was an interesting detail. TOON is meant to represent structured data in as few tokens as possible, but it turns out the model's unfamiliarity with that format led to them spending significantly more tokens over multiple iterations trying to figure it out:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a figure from a research paper. Introductory text reads: &quot;As schema size increased, TOON showed dramatically increased token consumption for Claude models despite being ~25% smaller in file size. Scale experiments used Claude models only.&quot; Below is &quot;Figure 7: The 'Grep Tax' - TOON Token Overhead at Scale&quot;, a bar chart with a logarithmic y-axis labeled &quot;Tokens&quot; comparing YAML (teal) and TOON (purple) at two schema sizes: S5 (500 tables) and S9 (10,000 tables). At S5, TOON is +138% more tokens than YAML (~1,100 vs ~450). At S9, TOON is +740% more tokens (~50,000 vs ~7,000). Below the chart, explanatory text reads: &quot;The 'grep tax' emerged as schema size scaled. At S5 (500 tables), TOON consumed 138% more tokens than YAML; at S9 (10,000 tables), this grew to 740%. Root cause: models lacked familiarity with TOON's syntax and could not construct effective refinement patterns.&quot;\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/grep-tax.jpg\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020150077637997013\">@omarsar0</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-engineering\">prompt-engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/paper-review\">paper-review</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/context-engineering\">context-engineering</a></p>",
