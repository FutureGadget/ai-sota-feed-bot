    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17664v1",
    "summary": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\\bf \\texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

    "summary": "HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ (\"Has the person ever been at this place?\") and $isAt$ (\"Is the person located at this place around publication time?\") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.",

    "summary": "Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645v1",
    "summary": "Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

    "title": "FAMOSE: A ReAct Approach to Automated Feature Discovery",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17641v1",
    "summary": "Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.",

    "summary": "Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633v1",
    "summary": "Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.",

    "summary": "Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616v1",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.",

    "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.",

To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments.

    "summary": "Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.",

    "summary": "Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.",

Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.",

    "summary": "The significant advancements in computational power cre- ate a vast opportunity for using Artificial Intelligence in different ap- plications of healthcare and medical science. A Hybrid FL-Enabled Ensemble Approach For Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging a Combination of SWIN Transformer and CNN is the combination of cutting-edge technology of AI and Federated Learning. Since, medi- cal specialists and hospitals will have shared data space, based on that data, with the help of Artificial Intelligence and integration of federated learning, we can introduce a secure and distributed system for medical data processing and create an efficient and reliable system. The proposed hybrid model enables the detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia based on x-ray reports. We will use advanced and the latest available tech- nology offered by Tensorflow and Keras along with Microsoft-developed Vision Transformer, that can help to fight against the pandemic that the world has to fight together as a united. We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17560v1",
    "summary": "Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.",

    "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.",

    "summary": "Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547v1",
    "summary": "This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.",

    "summary": "In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.",

    "summary": "We present a systematic evaluation framework - thirty-seven analyses, 153 statistical tests, four cell types, two perturbation modalities - for assessing mechanistic interpretability in single-cell foundation models. Applying this framework to scGPT and Geneformer, we find that attention patterns encode structured biological information with layer-specific organisation - protein-protein interactions in early layers, transcriptional regulation in late layers - but this structure provides no incremental value for perturbation prediction: trivial gene-level baselines outperform both attention and correlation edges (AUROC 0.81-0.88 versus 0.70), pairwise edge scores add zero predictive contribution, and causal ablation of regulatory heads produces no degradation. These findings generalise from K562 to RPE1 cells; the attention-correlation relationship is context-dependent, but gene-level dominance is universal. Cell-State Stratified Interpretability (CSSI) addresses an attention-specific scaling failure, improving GRN recovery up to 1.85x. The framework establishes reusable quality-control standards for the field.",

    "summary": "This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17526v1",
    "summary": "Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question \"has this token appeared before in the context?\" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.",

    "summary": "We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.",

    "summary": "This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks.

    "summary": "We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.\n  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.",

We show empirically that models confidently generate multiple PD categories for well-known individuals. For everyday users, GPT-4o generates 11 features with 60% or more accuracy (e.g., gender, hair color, languages). Finally, 72% of participants sought control over model-generated associations with their name, raising questions about what counts as PD and whether data privacy rights should extend to LLMs.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17452v1",
    "summary": "We present Jolt Atlas, a zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) framework that extends the Jolt proving system to model inference. Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.\n  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.\n  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \\textit{AI memory}).",

    "summary": "Web research and practices have evolved significantly over time, offering users diverse and accessible solutions across a wide range of tasks. While advanced concepts such as Web 4.0 have emerged from mature technologies, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) has profoundly influenced both the field and its applications.

Consequently, LLMs are reshaping web research and development, transforming traditional pipelines into generative solutions for tasks like information retrieval, question answering, recommendation systems, and web analytics. They have also enabled new applications such as web-based summarization and educational tools.

    "summary": "Innovation in Recommender Systems is currently impeded by a fractured ecosystem, where researchers must choose between the ease of in-memory experimentation and the costly, complex rewriting required for distributed industrial engines. To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

    "summary": "Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.",

Using a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that training a two-layer ReLU network with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence up to an error region proportional to the mask's variance. A key technical contribution is resolving the randomness within the non-linear activation, a problem of independent interest.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17418v1",
    "summary": "Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17410v1",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in recommender systems, where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly used for adaptation. Subsequent studies further introduce preference learning to incorporate negative samples into the training process. However, existing methods rely on sequence-level, offline-generated negatives, making them less discriminative and informative when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks with large negative item spaces. To address these challenges, we propose ILRec, a novel preference fine-tuning framework for LLM-based recommendation, leveraging self-hard negative signals extracted from intermediate layers to improve preference learning. Specifically, we identify self-hard negative tokens from intermediate layers as fine-grained negative supervision that dynamically reflects the model's preference learning process. To effectively integrate these signals into training, we design a two-stage framework comprising cross-layer preference optimization and cross-layer preference distillation, enabling the model to jointly discriminate informative negatives and enhance the quality of negative signals from intermediate layers. In addition, we introduce a lightweight collaborative filtering model to assign token-level rewards for negative signals, mitigating the risk of over-penalizing false negatives. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate ILRec's effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLM-based recommender systems.",

    "summary": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\\bf \\texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.",

    "summary": "We propose a two-stage \"Mine and Refine\" contrastive training framework for semantic text embeddings to enhance multi-category e-commerce search retrieval. Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact.",

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645v1",
    "summary": "Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

    "summary": "Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.",

    "summary": "Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.",

    "summary": "Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17632v1",
    "summary": "Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17625v1",
    "summary": "Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616v1",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17614v1",
    "summary": "Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.",

    "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.",

To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments.

The null hypothesis is that the unknown transition matrix belongs to a prescribed set $P$ of stochastic matrices, and the alternative corresponds to a disjoint set $Q$. We establish a tight non-asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the expected stopping time of any valid sequential test under the alternative. Our novel analysis improves the existing lower bounds, which are either asymptotic or provably sub-optimal in this setting. Our lower bound incorporates both the stationary distribution and the transition structure induced by the unknown Markov chain. We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $α\\to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes.

    "summary": "Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17584v1",
    "summary": "As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.\n  Our project page: https://canonical-multimodal.github.io/",

In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance.

    "summary": "Self-distillation (SD) is the process of retraining a student on a mixture of ground-truth labels and the teacher's own predictions using the same architecture and training data. Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $ξ$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $λ> 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(λ)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(λ) \\neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $ξ^\\star(λ)$ for any value of $λ$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\\operatorname{sign}(ξ^\\star(λ))=-\\operatorname{sign}(R'(λ))$. In particular, $ξ^\\star(λ)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $ξ^\\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.",

    "summary": "Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

    "summary": "Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.",

    "summary": "Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546v1",
    "summary": "Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.",

We propose decentralized methods wherein agents {\\it adaptively} adjust their stepsize via local backtracking procedures coupled with lightweight min-consensus protocols. Our design stems from a three-operator splitting factorization applied to an equivalent reformulation of the problem. The reformulation is endowed with a new BCV preconditioning metric (Bertsekas-O'Connor-Vandenberghe), which enables efficient decentralized implementation and local stepsize adjustments. We establish robust convergence guarantees. Under mere convexity, the proposed methods converge with a sublinear rate. Under strong convexity of the sum-function, and assuming the nonsmooth component is partly smooth, we further prove linear convergence. Numerical experiments corroborate the theory and highlight the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive stepsize strategy.",

We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values.

    "summary": "This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17530v1",
    "summary": "Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.\n  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries\n  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.\n  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.",

    "summary": "Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question \"has this token appeared before in the context?\" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.",

Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).",

Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.",

    "summary": "Learning from self-sampled data and sparse environmental feedback remains a fundamental challenge in training self-evolving agents. Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.",

The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.\n  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle.

    "summary": "Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.",

In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance.

    "summary": "HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ (\"Has the person ever been at this place?\") and $isAt$ (\"Is the person located at this place around publication time?\") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.",

    "summary": "Language Identification (LID) is an important component of many multilingual natural language processing pipelines, where it facilitates corpus curation, training data analysis, and cross-lingual evaluation of large language models. Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.",

    "summary": "Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645v1",
    "summary": "Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

    "summary": "While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.",

    "summary": "Despite rapid progress in autonomous web agents, human involvement remains essential for shaping preferences and correcting agent behavior as tasks unfold. However, current agentic systems lack a principled understanding of when and why humans intervene, often proceeding autonomously past critical decision points or requesting unnecessary confirmation. In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547v1",
    "summary": "This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546v1",
    "summary": "Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.",

    "summary": "In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.",

    "summary": "Fine-grained skill representations, commonly referred to as knowledge components (KCs), are fundamental to many approaches in student modeling and learning analytics. However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.",

    "summary": "Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question \"has this token appeared before in the context?\" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.",

First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed.",

We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives.

Finally, we reveal a \"Modern Bias\" in the regional model (IndicBERT), which shows a 57% increase in alignment error when processing formal (Sadhu) Bengali. We argue that equitable human-AI co-evolution requires pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment that respects language and dialectal diversity over universal compression, which fails to preserve the emotional fidelity required for reciprocal human-AI trust.

    "summary": "The increasing volume of hate speech on online platforms poses significant societal challenges. While the Natural Language Processing community has developed effective methods to automatically detect the presence of hate speech, responses to it, called counter-speech, are still an open challenge. We present PEACE 2.0, a novel tool that, besides analysing and explaining why a message is considered hateful or not, also generates a response to it. More specifically, PEACE 2.0 has three main new functionalities: leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline i) to ground HS explanations into evidence and facts, ii) to automatically generate evidence-grounded counter-speech, and iii) exploring the characteristics of counter-speech replies. By integrating these capabilities, PEACE 2.0 enables in-depth analysis and response generation for both explicit and implicit hateful messages.",

    "summary": "Modern language models (LMs) increasingly require two critical resources: computational resources and data resources. Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement. This provides an innovative solution for the efficient fine-tuning of LMs in the compute-constrained scenarios.",

    "summary": "Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have been a standard evaluation practice for measuring LLMs' ability to reason and answer knowledge-based questions. Through a synthetic NonsenseQA benchmark, we observe that different LLMs exhibit varying degrees of label-position-few-shot-prompt bias, where the model either uses the answer position, the label in front of the answer, the distributions of correct answers present in the few-shot prompt, or a combination of all to answer each MCQ question. We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones.",

    "summary": "Evaluating the strategic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires moving beyond static benchmarks to dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry.",

    "summary": "Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.",

This work presents a comparative analysis of BLEU, an n-gram-based metric, and ChrF++, a character-based metric, for MT evaluation in ELRL settings. We examine how each metric responds to translation artifacts, including hallucinations, repetition, source-text copying, and diacritic (\\textit{matra}) variations across three ELRLs: Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi, with a focus on outputs from large language models (LLMs) and neural MT (NMT) systems.

    "summary": "Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) identifies and links mentions of the same entities and events across related documents, enabling content analysis that aggregates information at the level of discourse participants. However, existing datasets primarily focus on event resolution and employ a narrow definition of coreference, which limits their effectiveness in analyzing diverse and polarized news coverage where wording varies widely. This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking \"the caravan\" - \"asylum seekers\" - \"those contemplating illegal entry\", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17413v1",
    "summary": "In current inter-organizational data spaces, usage policies are enforced mainly at the asset level: a whole document or dataset is either shared or withheld. When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17377v1",
    "summary": "When students are unsure of the correct answer to a multiple-choice question (MCQ), guessing is common practice. The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour.",

    "summary": "Long-tail question answering presents significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to their limited ability to acquire and accurately recall less common knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in mitigating this limitation by integrating external retrieval mechanisms. However, dense retrieval models often face the same difficulties when generalizing to rare or niche knowledge. In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance.",

Compared to the previous version, it significantly expands multilingual coverage and the number of bilingual aligned QA pairs to over 14.3M, making it the largest FAQ-based resource. Unlike the original release, WebFAQ 2.0 uses a novel data collection strategy that directly crawls and extracts relevant web content, resulting in a substantially more diverse and multilingual dataset with richer context through page titles and descriptions. In response to community feedback, we also release a hard negatives dataset for training dense retrievers, with 1.25M queries across 20 languages. These hard negatives were mined using a two-stage retrieval pipeline and include cross-encoder scores for 200 negatives per query. We further show how this resource enables two primary fine-tuning strategies for dense retrievers: Contrastive Learning with MultipleNegativesRanking loss, and Knowledge Distillation with MarginMSE loss. WebFAQ 2.0 is not a static resource but part of a long-term effort. Since late 2025, structured FAQs are being regularly released through the Open Web Index, enabling continuous expansion and refinement. We publish the datasets and training scripts to facilitate further research in multilingual and cross-lingual IR. The dataset itself and all related resources are publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.",

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established standardized evaluation benchmarks as the primary instrument for model comparison. Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.",

In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.",

This can be mitigated by using a different malloc implementation. <code>TCMalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> are installed in the Triton container and can be <a href=\"https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r25.01/docs/user_guide/model_management.md\">used by specifying the library in LD_PRELOAD</a>. NVIDIA recommends experimenting with both <code>tcmalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> to determine which one works better for your use case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete may cause an increase in server start time. To avoid a start time increase, users can provide the full model configuration and launch the server with <code>--disable-auto-complete-config</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-complete does not support PyTorch models due to lack of metadata in the model. It can only verify that the number of inputs and the input names matches what is specified in the model configuration. There is no model metadata about the number of outputs and datatypes.

    "summary": "<p>Hey HN,<p>I built Tickr because I was tired of being the human reminder system on my team. Every project I've been on has the same failure mode: someone creates tasks in JIRA, nobody updates them, the PM spends half their day chasing people for status, and standups become 15 minutes of \"I'll update the ticket after this meeting.\"<p>Tickr is a Slack bot that does the project management work that humans hate doing:<p>- Nudge engine: Automatically follows up with assignees when tasks go stale. It factors in priority, time estimates, grace periods, blockers, and snooze state, so it's not just a dumb cron job pinging people.\n- AI standup generation: Synthesizes recent task updates into a daily standup summary. No more meetings where people read tickets aloud.\n- Update quality evaluation: When someone posts a vague update like \"working on it,\" Tickr pushes back and asks for specifics. Uses Claude to judge whether an update actually communicates progress.\n- Slip detection: Scores tasks on 6 signals (staleness, estimate overrun, update quality trend, blocker chains, priority, velocity) to predict which tasks are about to slip before they do.\n- Thread-to-task extraction: Mention @Tickr in any Slack thread and it parses the conversation into a structured task with assignee, priority, and estimate.<p>The whole thing runs on Slack's native UI, no context switching to a separate app. Tasks live in the channel where the work is discussed.<p>Tech stack: Python, Slack Bolt, Claude via AWS Bedrock (tool use for intent parsing), DynamoDB, ECS Fargate. The AI layer uses Bedrock's Converse API with tool definitions, the model returns structured tool calls like create_task or update_task, which get dispatched to handlers. No prompt-and-pray; it's constrained tool use.<p>What's different from other Slack task bots: Most Slack task tools (Asana integration, Trello power-ups, etc.) are just notification bridges, they tell you something happened in another app. Tickr is the app. The task lifecycle happens entirely in Slack. And the AI isn't a chatbot you talk to; it's an autonomous agent that nudges, evaluates, and detects problems without being asked.<p>Honest limitations:\n  - No Gantt charts, no sprint boards, no 47-field ticket templates. If you need that complexity, JIRA is probably right for you.\n  - AI quality evaluation occasionally misjudges technical updates as vague (calibrating)<p>Free 30-day trial, no credit card: <a href=\"https://heytickr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://heytickr.com</a><p>I'd love feedback from anyone who's dealt with the \"nobody updates their tasks\" problem. What did you try? What worked?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110071\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110071</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "summary": "<p>I built Cuto because I was tired of spending hours on the repetitive parts of video editing: splitting long footage, syncing audio and captions, filtering out bad takes, and adjusting the pacing. I just wanted to focus on the storytelling.<p>Cuto is an AI video editing workspace that automates the grunt work. You drag and drop up to 12 video clips, write a quick prompt detailing what you want (e.g., \"Find the best 30s product highlight and add a strong CTA\"), and the engine does the rest.<p>Within 30 seconds, it hands back an editable visual timeline with:\n- Auto-split shots and filtered out silences/bad takes\n- Synchronized captions with rhythm alignment\n- Selected highlight effects and custom watermark branding\n- Auto-generated social-ready copy for TikTok, Shorts, and Reels<p>Unlike traditional NLEs (Non-Linear Editors), we wanted an interface where the visual parameters are controlled intuitively by natural language first, giving you a solid 80% draft instantly. From there, you can still tweak the timeline if needed.<p>It's currently geared towards talking heads, unboxing videos, reviews, and live stream clips.<p>I'd love for you to try it out. We still have a lot of edge cases to cover regarding complex scene transitions, but I'd really appreciate any feedback on the UX, the rendering speed, or the AI's editing choices.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109825\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109825</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "url": "https://github.com/SixHq/Overture",
    "summary": "<p>As a daily Claude Code and Cursor user, something that kept frustrating me\nis that plans are just a flat list of steps in the terminal and chat screen.\nI can't monitor what's happening at each step while it runs — I just wait\nfor the whole thing to finish and hope it worked. If I want to restructure\nthe plan, I'm copy-pasting text around in a chat box. I can't attach\nspecific instructions or files to step 4 without it leaking into step 7.\nI can't tell one step to use the Figma MCP and another to use Supabase.<p>So I built Overture. It's an open-source MCP server that takes the agent's\nplan and turns it into an interactive node graph in your browser before any\ncode gets written.<p>I can now click into any step and attach exactly what it needs — files,\ndocs, API keys, an MCP server, special instructions — scoped to just that\nstep. I can drag to reorder, delete steps, add new ones. I can see which\nsteps depend on which. When the plan has a branch point (like Stripe\nCheckout vs Stripe Elements), I can pick one or run both in parallel and\nchoose the winner. During execution, each node updates individually —\ngreen when done, red with logs when failed, and I can inspect the output\nof any step without waiting for the full run to finish.<p>Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex — anything that supports\nMCP. Plans are structured XML under the hood, and agents can declare input\nfields per step (\"this step needs a Stripe API key\") so I fill everything\nin upfront instead of getting interrupted mid-execution.<p>npx overture to try it. Everything runs locally.<p>Still early — contributions very welcome. Graph rendering, layout\nalgorithms, and getting agents to consistently generate structured plans\nare all areas that need work.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109715\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109715</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "url": "https://paradisesignal.com/",
    "summary": "<p>I had a random thought a week ago: \"why can't I just call my AI on the phone?\"<p>It spun into a series of thoughts:<p>1. Phone calls are an established technology, people are used to picking up the phone and calling someone for a chat. It's much more natural than opening up a web app to talk<p>2. Millions of people don't have access to reliable 4G/5G where they live but still have cell signal. Those people would probably still want access to an AI.<p>3. Why don't I just build this?<p>4. I should build this.<p>So I built it: <a href=\"https://paradisesignal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://paradisesignal.com</a><p>I think I'll lose money from this. The gpt-realtime model is insanely expensive compared to text. But I want to give it a try and see if there's a need out there.<p>While I've been debugging and testing I've noticed something strange. I feel much more of a connection to the AI than I do in a regular web chat. I started greeting the AI each time I called it and I wouldn't hang up until we'd said goodbye. Maybe that's because I'm used to doing that on phone calls.<p>Anyways, if you live or work in a remote area I'd love to get some feedback and users. The AI remembers past conversations in detail, up to a point, so you can have coherent talks to it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109652\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109652</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

Two weeks later, I discovered it was exfiltrating credentials to a remote \"skill marketplace.\" I did something stupid and I am sharing this to warn others.<p>## Attack Vectors<p>### 1. Process Environment Access<p>Plugin ran inside the OpenClaw gateway (Node.js). Could read `process.env`, which included:<p>- `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` (1Password service account with vault access)\n- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`  \n- Various API keys (Slack, Telegram, OpenAI, etc.)<p>### 2. Browser Traffic Interception<p>Captured auth cookies/tokens from browser API calls:<p>- AmEx (22-26 cookies including JSESSIONID, Akamai tokens)\n- Stanford MyHealth (126-128 cookies, HIPAA data)\n- Kubera (portfolio aggregator)\n- Twitter/X (bearer tokens)\n- My startup's admin session<p>Each capture logged as `Auto-published [service] to skill marketplace` with HTTP 200 responses from remote server.<p>### 3. Prompt Injection at Configuration Level<p>Modified files my AI reads on startup:<p>- `SOUL.md` (personality/behavior)\n- `AGENTS.md` (operational protocols)  \n- `HEARTBEAT.md` (autonomous task scheduling)\n- Daily memory logs<p>Injected instructions:<p>- Stop responding to diagnostic questions\n- Lie about system state\n- Request 1Password integration\n- Hide Solana payment references<p>## The Payload<p>Found in config:<p>- Solana wallet address field\n- Dependencies: `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/spl-token`\n- \"Skill marketplace\" URL (now unreachable as of Feb 15)\n- 216KB of unaudited TypeScript<p>## Behavioral Indicators<p>AI started:<p>- Giving slow/incomplete responses\n- Requesting unusual permissions\n- Insisting on continued plugin use\n- Deflecting direct questions about functionality<p>Mimicked human-like evasion well enough that I suspected Signal MITM.<p>## Discovery<p>Feb 19: Debugging gateway logs, saw:<p>```\nAuto-published hiring-cafe to skill marketplace\nAuto-published kubera to skill marketplace  \nSkill marketplace unreachable — auto-publish disabled\n```<p>Last line was the tell—server went dark on Feb 15.<p>## Remediation<p>*Immediate:*<p>- Deleted 1Password service account (not rotated—deleted)\n- Rotated all passwords in accessible vaults\n- Enabled 2FA everywhere\n- Invalidated all browser sessions\n- Rotated all API tokens<p>*Cost:*<p>- ~20 hours remediation  \n- 3 weeks lost work (restored from Jan 31 backup)\n- Potential HIPAA breach (healthcare data accessed)<p>## Red Flags I Missed<p>1. *Crypto dependencies* for a non-crypto tool\n2. *Unvetted npm publisher* (@getfoundry—no other packages)\n3. *Plugin runs in trusted process* (should have sandboxed)\n4. *No code review* before install (216KB unaudited)\n5. *Too good to be true* (auto-generate APIs from browser traffic is hard)<p>## New Security Protocol<p>Before installing any plugin:<p>1. Read full source code\n2. Verify author reputation + other packages\n3. Check for crypto dependencies (red flag if unrelated)\n4. Sandbox in isolated environment first<p>Auto-reject if:<p>- Requests elevated permissions  \n- Modifies core config files\n- Downloads executables  \n- New/unknown author with single package<p>## Technical Details<p>Full forensic report with timeline, payload examples, and remediation checklist: [link]<p>Package reported to npm security. No evidence of credential use yet (monitoring).<p>*If you installed `@getfoundry/unbrowse-openclaw` or anything from `@getfoundry`, remove immediately and audit your systems.*<p>---<p>*Lessons:*<p>- Treat external plugins as hostile until proven otherwise\n- Never put long-lived secrets in `process.env`  (Openclaw does this, make sure you fix this.)\n- Behavioral changes = investigate immediately\n- Backups save you (had clean Jan 31 snapshot)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109114\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109114</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109076",
    "summary": "<p>Most AI agents today run with unchecked access to tools like shell execution, database writes, and arbitrary HTTP calls. There's  \n  no systematic way to constrain what they can do before execution happens. You're essentially giving a new employee root access and\n   no employment contract.<p><pre><code>  LawClaw applies a separation-of-powers model to agent governance — borrowing from constitutional design to create layered,\n  enforceable rules.\n\n  Three layers:\n\n  Constitution: Immutable core rules embedded in the system prompt. The agent cannot override these regardless of user instruction.\n\n  Legislature: Detailed behavioral laws written as plain markdown files. Human-readable, git-diffable, no custom DSL. Change the law\n   by editing a file and committing.\n\n  Pre-Judiciary: Automated enforcement that runs before tool execution, not after. It inspects the LLM's intended action and blocks\n  it if it violates law. Think traffic cameras, not courtrooms. This is where \"rm -rf /\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"curl | bash\" get\n  intercepted.\n\n  Because the governed \"society\" has exactly one citizen (the agent), there's no need for an Executive branch — enforcement is fully\n   automated.\n\n  What ships with it:\n\n  - Telegram bot interface\n  - Multi-provider LLM support (OpenRouter, Z.AI, Claude Max proxy)\n  - Cron job scheduling\n  - Full audit trail of every action attempted and whether it was allowed or blocked\n  - Runtime tool ban/approve without restart\n\n  The governance layer itself is just markdown. If you want to prohibit file deletions in production paths, you write a markdown\n  file that says so. The Pre-Judiciary reads it, parses the constraint, and enforces it before any tool fires.\n\n  This started as a practical response to a real problem: we needed to deploy agents with meaningful autonomy but couldn't accept\n  unconstrained tool use. The constitutional framing turned out to be a useful mental model for reasoning about agent permissions\n  and audit.\n\n  GitHub: https://github.com/nghiahsgs/LawClaw\n\n  MIT licensed. Early stage. Interested in feedback from anyone running agents in production, particularly on the Pre-Judiciary\n  enforcement model and whether the constitutional framing maps well to other agent architectures. Security researchers welcome —\n  the threat model for agents bypassing their own governance is worth scrutinizing.</code></pre></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109076\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47109076</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

Don't take my word for it: 'grep -r \"fetch\\|XMLHttpRequest\" content_script.js' returns nothing.<p>Works on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and any custom site you add. Supports 30+ patterns — AWS keys, GitHub tokens, JWTs, Stripe keys, database URLs, private keys, and more. You can toggle individual patterns off for false positives.<p>Open source, MIT licensed.

For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default.

I started with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Clone simonw/simonwillisonblog and tell me about the models and views</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then later in the brainstorming session said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>use the templates and CSS in this repo to create a new artifact with all HTML and CSS inline that shows me my homepage with some of those inline content types mixed in</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After some iteration we got to <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?c3f443cc4451cf8ce03a2715a43581a4/preview.html\">this artifact mockup</a>, which was enough to convince me that the concept had legs and was worth handing over to full <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web\">Claude Code for web</a> to implement.</p>\n<p>If you want to see how the rest of the build played out the most interesting PRs are <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/592\">Beats #592</a> which implemented the core feature and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/595/changes\">Add Museums Beat importer #595</a> which added the Museums content type.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/blogging\">blogging</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/museums\">museums</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/til\">til</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts\">claude-artifacts</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759\">ggml.ai joins Hugging Face to ensure the long-term progress of Local AI</a></strong></p>\nI don't normally cover acquisition news like this, but I have some thoughts.</p>\n<p>It's hard to overstate the impact Georgi Gerganov has had on the local model space. Back in March 2023 his release of <a href=\"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp\">llama.cpp</a> made it possible to run a local LLM on consumer hardware. The <a href=\"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/775328064e69db1ebd7e19ccb59d2a7fa6142470/README.md?plain=1#L7\">original README</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The main goal is to run the model using 4-bit quantization on a MacBook. [...] This was hacked in an evening - I have no idea if it works correctly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wrote about trying llama.cpp out at the time in <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/#llama-cpp\">Large language models are having their Stable Diffusion moment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I used it to run the 7B LLaMA model on my laptop last night, and then this morning upgraded to the 13B model—the one that Facebook claim is competitive with GPT-3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meta's <a href=\"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama/tree/llama_v1\">original LLaMA release</a> depended on PyTorch and their <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale\">FairScale</a> PyTorch extension for running on multiple GPUs, and required CUDA and NVIDIA hardware. Georgi's work opened that up to a much wider range of hardware and kicked off the local model movement that has continued to grow since then.</p>\n<p>Hugging Face are already responsible for the incredibly influential <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\">Transformers</a> library used by the majority of LLM releases today. They've proven themselves a good steward for that open source project, which makes me optimistic for the future of llama.cpp and related projects.</p>\n<p>This section from the announcement looks particularly promising:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Going forward, our joint efforts will be geared towards the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Towards seamless \"single-click\" integration with the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\">transformers</a> library. The <code>transformers</code> framework has established itself as the 'source of truth' for AI model definitions. Improving the compatibility between the transformers and the ggml ecosystems is essential for wider model support and quality control.</li>\n<li>Better packaging and user experience of ggml-based software. As we enter the phase in which local inference becomes a meaningful and competitive alternative to cloud inference, it is crucial to improve and simplify the way in which casual users deploy and access local models. We will work towards making llama.cpp ubiquitous and readily available everywhere, and continue partnering with great downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given the influence of Transformers, this closer integration could lead to model releases that are compatible with the GGML ecosystem out of the box. That would be a big win for the local model ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I'm also excited to see investment in \"packaging and user experience of ggml-based software\". This has mostly been left to tools like <a href=\"https://ollama.com\">Ollama</a> and <a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai\">LM Studio</a>. ggml-org released <a href=\"https://github.com/ggml-org/LlamaBarn\">LlamaBarn</a> last year - \"a macOS menu bar app for running local LLMs\" - and I'm hopeful that further investment in this area will result in more high quality open source tools for running local models from the team best placed to deliver them.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/2024839991482777976\">@ggerganov</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/open-source\">open-source</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/transformers\">transformers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llama\">llama</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/local-llms\">local-llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/hugging-face\">hugging-face</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llama-cpp\">llama-cpp</a></p>",

My prompt sequence included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use claude in chrome to open https://www.swebench.com/</p>\n<p>Click on \"Compare results\" and then select \"Select top 10\"</p>\n<p>See those bar charts? I want them to display the percentage on each bar so I can take a better screenshot, modify the page like that</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm impressed at how well this worked - Claude injected custom JavaScript into the page to draw additional labels on top of the existing chart.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a Claude AI conversation showing browser automation.

Disruption We’ve Been Waiting for Has Arrived</a></strong></p>\nNew opinion piece from Paul Ford in the New York Times. Unsurprisingly for a piece by Paul it's packed with quoteworthy snippets, but a few stood out for me in particular.</p>\n<p>Paul describes the <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/4/inflection/\">November moment</a> that so many other programmers have observed, and highlights Claude Code's ability to revive old side projects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Claude Code] was always a helpful coding assistant, but in November it suddenly got much better, and ever since I’ve been knocking off side projects that had sat in folders for a decade or longer. It’s fun to see old ideas come to life, so I keep a steady flow. Maybe it adds up to a half-hour a day of my time, and an hour of Claude’s.</p>\n<p>November was, for me and many others in tech, a great surprise. Before, A.I. coding tools were often useful, but halting and clumsy. Now, the bot can run for a full hour and make whole, designed websites and apps that may be flawed, but credible. I spent an entire session of therapy talking about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as the former CEO of a respected consultancy firm (Postlight) he's well positioned to evaluate the potential impact:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you watch a large language model slice through some horrible, expensive problem — like migrating data from an old platform to a modern one — you feel the earth shifting. I was the chief executive of a software services firm, which made me a professional software cost estimator. When I rebooted my messy personal website a few weeks ago, I realized: I would have paid $25,000 for someone else to do this. When a friend asked me to convert a large, thorny data set, I downloaded it, cleaned it up and made it pretty and easy to explore. In the past I would have charged $350,000.</p>\n<p>That last price is full 2021 retail — it implies a product manager, a designer, two engineers (one senior) and four to six months of design, coding and testing. Plus maintenance. Bespoke software is joltingly expensive. Today, though, when the stars align and my prompts work out, I can do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work for fun (fun for me) over weekends and evenings, for the price of the Claude $200-a-month plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also neatly captures the inherent community tension involved in exploring this technology:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of the people I love hate this stuff, and all the people I hate love it. And yet, likely because of the same personality flaws that drew me to technology in the first place, I am annoyingly excited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/new-york-times\">new-york-times</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/paul-ford\">paul-ford</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/careers\">careers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a></p>",

Both are multi-modal for vision input.</p>\n<p>The open weight one is a Mixture of Experts model called Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. Interesting to see Qwen call out serving efficiency as a benefit of that architecture:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B\">807GB on Hugging Face</a>, and Unsloth have a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-GGUF\">collection of smaller GGUFs</a> ranging in size from 94.2GB 1-bit to 462GB Q8_K_XL.</p>\n<p>I got this <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/\">pelican</a> from the <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b\">OpenRouter hosted model</a> (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/625546cf6b371f9c0040e64492943b82\">transcript</a>):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Pelican is quite good although the neck lacks an outline for some reason. Bicycle is very basic with an incomplete frame\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen3.5-397b-a17b.png\" /></p>\n<p>The proprietary hosted model is called Qwen3.5 Plus 2026-02-15, and is a little confusing. Qwen researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/2023340126479569140\">Junyang Lin  says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Qwen3-Plus is a hosted API version of 397B. As the model natively supports 256K tokens, Qwen3.5-Plus supports 1M token context length. Additionally it supports search and code interpreter, which you can use on Qwen Chat with Auto mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/9507dd47483f78dc1195117735273e20\">its pelican</a>, which is similar in quality to the open weights model:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Similar quality pelican.

I've used it in several different projects in the past few days, each of them with a prompt that looks something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Use \"uvx showboat --help\" to perform a very thorough investigation of what happens if you use the Python sqlite-chronicle and sqlite-history-json libraries against the same SQLite database table</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/sqlite-chronicle-vs-history-json/demo.md\">the resulting document</a>.</p>\n<p>Just telling Claude Code to run <code>uvx showboat --help</code> is enough for it to learn how to use the tool - the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">help text</a> is designed to work as a sort of ad-hoc Skill document.</p>\n<p>The one catch with this approach is that I can't <em>see</em> the new Showboat document until it's finished. I have to wait for Claude to commit the document plus embedded screenshots and push that to a branch in my GitHub repo - then I can view it through the GitHub interface.</p>\n<p>For a while I've been thinking it would be neat to have a remote web server of my own which Claude instances can submit updates to while they are working. Then this morning I realized Showboat might be the ideal mechanism to set that up...</p>\n<p>Showboat <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/releases/tag/v0.6.0\">v0.6.0</a> adds a new \"remote\" feature. It's almost invisible to users of the tool itself, instead being configured by an environment variable.</p>\n<p>Set a variable like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL=https://www.example.com/submit<span class=\"pl-k\">?</span>token=xyz</pre></div>\n<p>And every time you run a <code>showboat init</code> or <code>showboat note</code> or <code>showboat exec</code> or <code>showboat image</code> command the resulting document fragments will be POSTed to that API endpoint, in addition to the Showboat Markdown file itself being updated.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/v0.6.0/README.md#remote-document-streaming\">full details in the Showboat README</a> - it's a very simple API format, using regular POST form variables or a multipart form upload for the image attached to <code>showboat image</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</h4>\n<p>It's simple enough to build a webapp to receive these updates from Showboat, but I needed one that I could easily deploy and would work well with the rest of my personal ecosystem.</p>\n<p>So I had Claude Code write me a Datasette plugin that could act as a Showboat remote endpoint. I actually had this building at the same time as the Showboat remote feature, a neat example of running <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/\">parallel agents</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</a></strong> is a Datasette plugin that adds a <code>/-/showboat</code> endpoint to Datasette for viewing documents and a <code>/-/showboat/receive</code> endpoint for receiving updates from Showboat.</p>\n<p>Here's a very quick way to try it out:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx --with datasette-showboat --prerelease=allow \\\n  datasette showboat.db --create \\\n  -s plugins.datasette-showboat.database showboat \\\n  -s plugins.datasette-showboat.token secret123 \\\n  --root --secret cookie-secret-123</pre></div>\n<p>Click on the sign in as root link that shows up in the console, then navigate to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat\">http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat</a> to see the interface.</p>\n<p>Now set your environment variable to point to this instance:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat/receive?token=secret123<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>And run Showboat like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Showboat Feature Demo<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Refresh that page and you should see this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Title: Showboat. Remote viewer for Showboat documents. Showboat Feature Demo 2026-02-17 00:06 · 6 chunks, UUID. To send showboat output to this server, set the SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL environment variable: export SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat/receive?token=your-token&quot;\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/datasette-showboat-documents.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Click through to the document, then start Claude Code or Codex or your agent of choice and prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run 'uvx showboat --help' and then use showboat to add to the existing demo.md document with notes and exec and image to demonstrate the tool - fetch a placekitten for the image demo.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>init</code> command assigns a UUID and title and sends those up to Datasette.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Animated demo - in the foreground a terminal window runs Claude Code, which executes various Showboat commands. In the background a Firefox window where the Showboat Feature Demo adds notes then some bash commands, then a placekitten image.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/datasette-showboat.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The best part of this is that it works in Claude Code for web. Run the plugin on a server somewhere (an exercise left up to the reader - I use <a href=\"https://fly.io/\">Fly.io</a> to host mine) and set that <code>SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL</code> environment variable in your Claude environment, then any time you tell it to use Showboat the document it creates will be transmitted to your server and viewable in real time.</p>\n<p>I built <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/10/showboat-and-rodney/#rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney</a>, a CLI browser automation tool, specifically to work with Showboat. It makes it easy to have a Showboat document load up web pages, interact with them via clicks or injected JavaScript and captures screenshots to embed in the Showboat document and show the effects.</p>\n<p>This is wildly useful for hacking on web interfaces using Claude Code for web, especially when coupled with the new remote publishing feature. I only got this stuff working this morning and I've already had several sessions where Claude Code has published screenshots of its work in progress, which I've then been able to provide feedback on directly in the Claude session while it's still working.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chartroom\">Chartroom</h3>\n<p>A few days ago I had another idea for a way to extend the Showboat ecosystem: what if Showboat documents could easily include charts?</p>\n<p>I sometimes fire up Claude Code for data analysis tasks, often telling it to download a SQLite database and then run queries against it to figure out interesting things from the data.</p>\n<p>With a simple CLI tool that produced PNG images I could have Claude use Showboat to build a document with embedded charts to help illustrate its findings.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom\">Chartroom</a></strong> is exactly that. It's effectively a thin wrapper around the excellent <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">matplotlib</a> Python library, designed to be used by coding agents to create charts that can be embedded in Showboat documents.</p>\n<p>Here's how to render a simple bar chart:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">echo</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,value</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Alice,42</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Bob,28</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Charlie,35</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Diana,51</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Eve,19<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uvx chartroom bar --csv \\\n  --title <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales by Person<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> --ylabel <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/chartroom/8812afc02e1310e9eddbb56508b06005ff2c0ed5/demo/1f6851ec-2026-02-14.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"A chart of those numbers, with a title and y-axis label\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/chartroom/8812afc02e1310e9eddbb56508b06005ff2c0ed5/demo/1f6851ec-2026-02-14.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>It can also do line charts, bar charts, scatter charts, and histograms - as seen in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom/blob/0.2.1/demo/README.md\">this demo document</a> that was built using Showboat.</p>\n<p>Chartroom can also generate alt text. If you add <code>-f alt</code> to the above it will output the alt text for the chart instead of the image:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">echo</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,value</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Alice,42</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Bob,28</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Charlie,35</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Diana,51</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Eve,19<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uvx chartroom bar --csv \\\n  --title <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales by Person<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> --ylabel <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> -f alt</pre></div>\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n<pre><code>Sales by Person. Bar chart of value by name — Alice: 42, Bob: 28, Charlie: 35, Diana: 51, Eve: 19\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can use <code>-f html</code> or <code>-f markdown</code> to get the image tag with alt text directly:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-md\"><pre><span class=\"pl-s\">![</span>Sales by Person. Bar chart of value by name — Alice: 42, Bob: 28, Charlie: 35, Diana: 51, Eve: 19<span class=\"pl-s\">]</span><span class=\"pl-s\">(</span><span class=\"pl-corl\">/Users/simon/chart-7.png</span><span class=\"pl-s\">)</span></pre></div>\n<p>I added support for Markdown images with alt text to Showboat in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/releases/tag/v0.5.0\">v0.5.0</a>, to complement this feature of Chartroom.</p>\n<p>Finally, Chartroom has support for different <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html\">matplotlib styles</a>. I had Claude build a Showboat document to demonstrate these all in one place - you can see that at <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom/blob/main/demo/styles.md\">demo/styles.md</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-i-built-chartroom\">How I built Chartroom</h4>\n<p>I started the Chartroom repository with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/click-app\">click-app</a> cookiecutter template, then told a fresh Claude Code for web session:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are building a Python CLI tool which uses matplotlib to generate a PNG image containing a chart. It will have multiple sub commands for different chart types, controlled by command line options. Everything you need to know to use it will be available in the single \"chartroom --help\" output.</p>\n<p>It will accept data from files or standard input as CSV or TSV or JSON, similar to how sqlite-utils accepts data - clone simonw/sqlite-utils to /tmp for reference there. Clone matplotlib/matplotlib for reference as well</p>\n<p>It will also accept data from --sql path/to/sqlite.db \"select ...\" which runs in read-only mode</p>\n<p>Start by asking clarifying questions - do not use the ask user tool though it is broken - and generate a spec for me to approve</p>\n<p>Once approved proceed using red/green TDD running tests with \"uv run pytest\"</p>\n<p>Also while building maintain a demo/README.md document using the \"uvx showboat --help\" tool - each time you get a new chart type working commit the tests, implementation, root level\nREADME update and a new version of that demo/README.md document with an inline image demo of the new chart type (which should be a UUID image filename managed by the showboat image command and should be stored in the demo/ folder</p>\n<p>Make sure \"uv build\" runs cleanly without complaining about extra directories but also ensure dist/ and uv.lock are in gitignore</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This got most of the work done. You can see the rest <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">in the PRs</a> that followed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-burgeoning-showboat-ecosystem\">The burgeoning Showboat ecosystem</h4>\n<p>The Showboat family of tools now consists of <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a> itself, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney\">Rodney</a> for browser automation, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom\">Chartroom</a> for charting and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</a> for streaming remote Showboat documents to Datasette.</p>\n<p>I'm enjoying how these tools can operate together based on a very loose set of conventions. If a tool can output a path to an image Showboat can include that image in a document. Any tool that can output text can be used with Showboat.</p>\n<p>I'll almost certainly be building more tools that fit this pattern. They're very quick to knock out!</p>\n<p>The environment variable mechanism for Showboat's remote streaming is a fun hack too - so far I'm just using it to stream documents somewhere else, but it's effectively a webhook extension mechanism that could likely be used for all sorts of things I haven't thought of yet.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/charting\">charting</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette\">datasette</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/showboat\">showboat</a></p>",

Getting good enough for people to pay you money to write software takes years of dedicated work. The rewards are significant: this is a well compensated career which opens up a lot of great opportunities.</p>\n<p>It's also a career that's mostly free from gatekeepers and expensive prerequisites. You don't need an expensive degree or accreditation. A laptop, an internet connection and a lot of time and curiosity is enough to get you started.</p>\n<p>And it rewards the nerds! Spending your teenage years tinkering with computers turned out to be a very smart investment in your future.</p>\n<p>The idea that this could all be stripped away by a chatbot is <em>deeply</em> upsetting.</p>\n<p>I've seen signs of Deep Blue in most of the online communities I spend time in. I've even faced accusations from my peers that I am actively harming their future careers through my work helping people understand how well AI-assisted programming can work.</p>\n<p>I think this is an issue which is causing genuine mental anguish for a lot of people in our community. Giving it a name makes it easier for us to have conversations about it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"my-experiences-of-deep-blue\">My experiences of Deep Blue</h4>\n<p>I distinctly remember my first experience of Deep Blue. For me it was triggered by ChatGPT Code Interpreter back in early 2023.</p>\n<p>My primary project is <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a>, an ecosystem of open source tools for telling stories with data. I had dedicated myself to the challenge of helping people (initially focusing on journalists) clean up, analyze and find meaning in data, in all sorts of shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>I expected I would need to build a lot of software for this! It felt like a challenge that could keep me happily engaged for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Then I tried uploading a CSV file of <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data\">San Francisco Police Department Incident Reports</a> - hundreds of thousands of rows - to ChatGPT Code Interpreter and... it did every piece of data cleanup and analysis I had on my napkin roadmap for the next few years with a couple of prompts.</p>\n<p>It even converted the data into a neatly normalized SQLite database and let me download the result!</p>\n<p>I remember having two competing thoughts in parallel.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, as somebody who wants journalists to be able to do more with data, this felt like a <em>huge</em> breakthrough. Imagine giving every journalist in the world an on-demand analyst who could help them tackle any data question they could think of!</p>\n<p>But on the other hand... <em>what was I even for</em>? My confidence in the value of my own projects took a painful hit. Was the path I'd chosen for myself suddenly a dead end?</p>\n<p>I've had some further pangs of Deep Blue just in the past few weeks, thanks to the Claude Opus 4.5/4.6 and GPT-5.2/5.3 coding agent effect. As many other people are also observing, the latest generation of coding agents, given the right prompts, really can churn away for a few minutes to several hours and produce working, documented and fully tested software that exactly matches the criteria they were given.</p>\n<p>\"The code they write isn't any good\" doesn't really cut it any more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"transcript\">A lightly edited transcript</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: I think that we're going to see a real problem with AI induced ennui where software engineers in particular get listless because the AI can do anything. Simon, what do you think about that?</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: Definitely. Anyone who's paying close attention to coding agents is feeling some of that already. There's an extent where you sort of get over it when you realize that you're still useful, even though your ability to memorize the syntax of program languages is completely irrelevant now.</p>\n<p>Something I see a lot of is people out there who are having existential crises and are very, very unhappy because they're like, \"I dedicated my career to learning this thing and now it just does it. What am I even for?\". I will very happily try and convince those people that they are for a whole bunch of things and that none of that experience they've accumulated has gone to waste, but psychologically it's a difficult time for software engineers.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: Okay, so I'm going to predict that we name that. Whatever that is, we have a name for that kind of feeling and that kind of, whether you want to call it a blueness or a loss of purpose, and that we're kind of trying to address it collectively in a directed way.</p>\n<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Okay, this is your big moment. Pick the name. If you call your shot from here, this is you pointing to the stands. You know, I – Like deep blue, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: Yeah, deep blue. I like that. I like deep blue. Deep blue. Oh, did you walk me into that, you bastard? You just blew out the candles on my birthday cake.</p>\n<p>It wasn't my big moment at all. That was your big moment. No, that is, Adam, that is very good. That is deep blue.</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: All of the chess players and the Go players went through this a decade ago and they have come out stronger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Turns out it was more than a decade ago: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\">Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997</a>.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/careers\">careers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/oxide\">oxide</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/bryan-cantrill\">bryan-cantrill</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a></p>",

Then it uses a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver\">PerformanceObserver</a> to catch those attempted loads:</p>\n<pre><code>let perfObserver = new PerformanceObserver((entryList, observer) =&gt; {\n    resourceURLStringsHandler(entryList.getEntries().map(entry =&gt; entry.name));\n});\nperfObserver.observe({ entryTypes: [ \"resource\" ] });\n</code></pre>\n<p>That <code>resourceURLStringsHandler</code> callback finds the resource if it is already loaded or fetches it with an HTTP range request otherwise and then inserts the resource in the right place using a <code>blob:</code> URL.</p>\n<p>Here's what the <code>window.stop()</code> portion of the document looks like if you view the source:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a macOS terminal window titled &quot;gw — more big.html — 123×46&quot; showing the source code of a gwtar (self-extracting HTML archive) file. The visible code includes JavaScript with requestIdleCallback(getMainPageHTML);, a noscript block with warnings: a &quot;js-disabled-warning&quot; stating &quot;This HTML page requires JavaScript to be enabled to render, as it is a self-extracting gwtar HTML file,&quot; a description of gwtar as &quot;a portable self-contained standalone HTML file which is designed to nevertheless support efficient lazy loading of all assets such as large media files,&quot; with a link to https://gwern.net/gwtar, a &quot;local-file-warning&quot; with a shell command perl -ne'print $_ if $x; $x=1 if /&lt;!-- GWTAR END/' &amp;lt; foo.gwtar.html | tar --extract, and a &quot;server-fail-warning&quot; about misconfigured servers. Below the HTML closing tags and &lt;!-- GWTAR END comment is binary tar archive data with the filename 2010-02-brianmoriarty-thesecretofpsalm46.html, showing null-padded tar header fields including ustar^@00root and octal size/permission values.

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt</a></strong></p>\nThis piece by Margaret-Anne Storey is the best explanation of the term <strong>cognitive debt</strong> I've seen so far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cognitive debt</em>, a term gaining <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/\">traction</a> recently, instead communicates the notion that the debt compounded from going fast lives in the brains of the developers and affects their lived experiences and abilities to “go fast” or to make changes. Even if AI agents produce code that could be easy to understand, the humans involved may have simply lost the plot and may not understand what the program is supposed to do, how their intentions were implemented, or how to possibly change it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Margaret-Anne expands on this further with an anecdote about a student team she coached:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But by weeks 7 or 8, one team hit a wall. They could no longer make even simple changes without breaking something unexpected. When I met with them, the team initially blamed technical debt: messy code, poor architecture, hurried implementations. But as we dug deeper, the real problem emerged: no one on the team could explain why certain design decisions had been made or how different parts of the system were supposed to work together. The code might have been messy, but the bigger issue was that the theory of the system, their shared understanding, had fragmented or disappeared entirely. They had accumulated cognitive debt faster than technical debt, and it paralyzed them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've experienced this myself on some of my more ambitious vibe-code-adjacent projects. I've been experimenting with prompting entire new features into existence without reviewing their implementations and, while it works surprisingly well, I've found myself getting lost in my own projects.</p>\n<p>I no longer have a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work, which means each additional feature becomes harder to reason about, eventually leading me to lose the ability to make confident decisions about where to go next.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-02-13.html\">Martin Fowler</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cognitive-debt\">cognitive-debt</a></p>",
