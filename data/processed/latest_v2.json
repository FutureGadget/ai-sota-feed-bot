    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\">SWE-bench February 2026 leaderboard update</a></strong></p>\nSWE-bench is one of the benchmarks that the labs love to list in their model releases. The official leaderboard is infrequently updated but they just did a full run of it against the current generation of models, which is notable because it's always good to see benchmark results like this that <em>weren't</em> self-reported by the labs.</p>\n<p>The fresh results are for their \"Bash Only\" benchmark, which runs their <a href=\"https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent\">mini-swe-bench</a> agent (~9,000 lines of Python, <a href=\"https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent/blob/v2.2.1/src/minisweagent/config/benchmarks/swebench.yaml\">here are the prompts</a> they use) against the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench\">SWE-bench</a> dataset of coding problems - 2,294 real-world examples pulled from 12 open source repos: <a href=\"https://github.com/django/django\">django/django</a> (850), <a href=\"https://github.com/sympy/sympy\">sympy/sympy</a> (386), <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn/scikit-learn</a> (229), <a href=\"https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx\">sphinx-doc/sphinx</a> (187), <a href=\"https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib\">matplotlib/matplotlib</a> (184), <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest\">pytest-dev/pytest</a> (119), <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/xarray\">pydata/xarray</a> (110), <a href=\"https://github.com/astropy/astropy\">astropy/astropy</a> (95), <a href=\"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint\">pylint-dev/pylint</a> (57), <a href=\"https://github.com/psf/requests\">psf/requests</a> (44), <a href=\"https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\">mwaskom/seaborn</a> (22), <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/flask\">pallets/flask</a> (11).</p>\n<p><strong>Correction</strong>: <em>The Bash only benchmark runs against SWE-bench Verified, not original SWE-bench.

Here's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified\">SWE-bench Verified</a> on Hugging Face - since it's just 2.1MB of Parquet it's easy to browse <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?parquet=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fdatasets%2Fprinceton-nlp%2FSWE-bench_Verified%2Fresolve%2Fmain%2Fdata%2Ftest-00000-of-00001.parquet#/data/test-00000-of-00001?_facet=repo\">using Datasette Lite</a>, which cuts those numbers down to django/django (231), sympy/sympy (75), sphinx-doc/sphinx (44), matplotlib/matplotlib (34), scikit-learn/scikit-learn (32), astropy/astropy (22), pydata/xarray (22), pytest-dev/pytest (19), pylint-dev/pylint (10), psf/requests (8), mwaskom/seaborn (2), pallets/flask (1)</em>.</p>\n<p>Here's how the top ten models performed:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Bar chart showing &quot;% Resolved&quot; by &quot;Model&quot;. Bars in descending order: Claude 4.5 Opus (high reasoning) 76.8%, Gemini 3 Flash (high reasoning) 75.8%, MiniMax M2.5 (high reasoning) 75.8%, Claude Opus 4.6 75.6%, GLM-5 (high reasoning) 72.8%, GPT-5.2 (high reasoning) 72.8%, Claude 4.5 Sonnet (high reasoning) 72.8%, Kimi K2.5 (high reasoning) 71.4%, DeepSeek V3.2 (high reasoning) 70.8%, Claude 4.5 Haiku (high reasoning) 70.0%, and a partially visible final bar at 66.6%.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/swbench-feb-2026.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It's interesting to see Claude Opus 4.5 beat Opus 4.6, though only by about a percentage point. 4.5 Opus is top, then Gemini 3 Flash, then MiniMax M2.5 - a 229B model released <a href=\"https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m25\">last week</a> by Chinese lab MiniMax. GLM-5, Kimi K2.5 and DeepSeek V3.2 are three more Chinese models that make the top ten as well.</p>\n<p>OpenAI's GPT-5.2 is their highest performing model at position 6, but it's worth noting that their best coding model, GPT-5.3-Codex, is not represented - maybe because it's not yet available in the OpenAI API.</p>\n<p>This benchmark uses the same system prompt for every model, which is important for a fair comparison but does mean that the quality of the different harnesses or optimized prompts is not being measured here.</p>\n<p>The chart above is a screenshot from the SWE-bench website, but their charts don't include the actual percentage values visible on the bars. I successfully used Claude for Chrome to add these - <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/81a0c519-c727-4caa-b0d4-0d866375d0da\">transcript here</a>. My prompt sequence included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use claude in chrome to open https://www.swebench.com/</p>\n<p>Click on \"Compare results\" and then select \"Select top 10\"</p>\n<p>See those bar charts? I want them to display the percentage on each bar so I can take a better screenshot, modify the page like that</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm impressed at how well this worked - Claude injected custom JavaScript into the page to draw additional labels on top of the existing chart.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a Claude AI conversation showing browser automation. A thinking step reads &quot;Pivoted strategy to avoid recursion issues with chart labeling &gt;&quot; followed by the message &quot;Good, the chart is back. Now let me carefully add the labels using an inline plugin on the chart instance to avoid the recursion issue.&quot; A collapsed &quot;Browser_evaluate&quot; section shows a browser_evaluate tool call with JavaScript code using Chart.js canvas context to draw percentage labels on bars: meta.data.forEach((bar, index) =&gt; { const value = dataset.data[index]; if (value !== undefined &amp;&amp; value !== null) { ctx.save(); ctx.textAlign = 'center'; ctx.textBaseline = 'bottom'; ctx.fillStyle = '#333'; ctx.font = 'bold 12px sans-serif'; ctx.fillText(value.toFixed(1) + '%', bar.x, bar.y - 5); A pending step reads &quot;Let me take a screenshot to see if it worked.&quot; followed by a completed &quot;Done&quot; step, and the message &quot;Let me take a screenshot to check the result.&quot;\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/claude-chrome-draw-on-chart.jpg\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KLieret/status/2024176335782826336\">@KLieret</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/benchmarks\">benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/django\">django</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openai\">openai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/anthropic\">anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude\">claude</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-in-china\">ai-in-china</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/minimax\">minimax</a></p>",

Disruption We’ve Been Waiting for Has Arrived</a></strong></p>\nNew opinion piece from Paul Ford in the New York Times. Unsurprisingly for a piece by Paul it's packed with quoteworthy snippets, but a few stood out for me in particular.</p>\n<p>Paul describes the <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/4/inflection/\">November moment</a> that so many other programmers have observed, and highlights Claude Code's ability to revive old side projects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Claude Code] was always a helpful coding assistant, but in November it suddenly got much better, and ever since I’ve been knocking off side projects that had sat in folders for a decade or longer. It’s fun to see old ideas come to life, so I keep a steady flow. Maybe it adds up to a half-hour a day of my time, and an hour of Claude’s.</p>\n<p>November was, for me and many others in tech, a great surprise. Before, A.I. coding tools were often useful, but halting and clumsy. Now, the bot can run for a full hour and make whole, designed websites and apps that may be flawed, but credible. I spent an entire session of therapy talking about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as the former CEO of a respected consultancy firm (Postlight) he's well positioned to evaluate the potential impact:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you watch a large language model slice through some horrible, expensive problem — like migrating data from an old platform to a modern one — you feel the earth shifting. I was the chief executive of a software services firm, which made me a professional software cost estimator. When I rebooted my messy personal website a few weeks ago, I realized: I would have paid $25,000 for someone else to do this. When a friend asked me to convert a large, thorny data set, I downloaded it, cleaned it up and made it pretty and easy to explore. In the past I would have charged $350,000.</p>\n<p>That last price is full 2021 retail — it implies a product manager, a designer, two engineers (one senior) and four to six months of design, coding and testing. Plus maintenance. Bespoke software is joltingly expensive. Today, though, when the stars align and my prompts work out, I can do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work for fun (fun for me) over weekends and evenings, for the price of the Claude $200-a-month plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also neatly captures the inherent community tension involved in exploring this technology:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of the people I love hate this stuff, and all the people I hate love it. And yet, likely because of the same personality flaws that drew me to technology in the first place, I am annoyingly excited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/new-york-times\">new-york-times</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/paul-ford\">paul-ford</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/careers\">careers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a></p>",

    "summary": "<h2>What's changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed FileWriteTool line counting to preserve intentional trailing blank lines instead of stripping them with <code>trimEnd()</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixed Windows terminal rendering bugs caused by <code>os.EOL</code> (<code>\\r\\n</code>) in display code — line counts now show correct values instead of always showing 1 on Windows.</li>\n<li>Improved VS Code plan preview: auto-updates as Claude iterates, enables commenting only when the plan is ready for review, and keeps the preview open when rejecting so Claude can revise.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where bold and colored text in markdown output could shift to the wrong characters on Windows due to <code>\\r\\n</code> line endings.</li>\n<li>Fixed compaction failing when conversation contains many PDF documents by stripping document blocks alongside images before sending to the compaction API (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26188\">#26188</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved memory usage in long-running sessions by releasing API stream buffers, agent context, and skill state after use</li>\n<li>Improved startup performance by deferring SessionStart hook execution, reducing time-to-interactive by ~500ms.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where bash tool output was silently discarded on Windows when using MSYS2 or Cygwin shells.</li>\n<li>Improved performance of <code>@</code> file mentions - file suggestions now appear faster by pre-warming the index on startup and using session-based caching with background refresh.</li>\n<li>Improved memory usage by trimming agent task message history after tasks complete</li>\n<li>Improved memory usage during long agent sessions by eliminating O(n²) message accumulation in progress updates</li>\n<li>Fixed the bash permission classifier to validate that returned match descriptions correspond to actual input rules, preventing hallucinated descriptions from incorrectly granting permissions</li>\n<li>Fixed user-defined agents only loading one file on NFS/FUSE filesystems that report zero inodes (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26044\">#26044</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed plugin agent skills silently failing to load when referenced by bare name instead of fully-qualified plugin name (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/25834\">#25834</a>)</li>\n<li>Search patterns in collapsed tool results are now displayed in quotes for clarity</li>\n<li>Windows: Fixed CWD tracking temp files never being cleaned up, causing them to accumulate indefinitely (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17600\">#17600</a>)</li>\n<li>Use <code>ctrl+f</code> to kill all background agents instead of double-pressing ESC. Background agents now continue running when you press ESC to cancel the main thread, giving you more control over agent lifecycle.</li>\n<li>Fixed API 400 errors (\"thinking blocks cannot be modified\") that occurred in sessions with concurrent agents, caused by interleaved streaming content blocks preventing proper message merging.</li>\n<li>Simplified teammate navigation to use only Shift+Down (with wrapping) instead of both Shift+Up and Shift+Down.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a single file write/edit error would abort all other parallel file write/edit operations. Independent file mutations now complete even when a sibling fails.</li>\n<li>Added <code>last_assistant_message</code> field to Stop and SubagentStop hook inputs, providing the final assistant response text so hooks can access it without parsing transcript files.</li>\n<li>Fixed custom session titles set via <code>/rename</code> being lost after resuming a conversation (<a

truncating from the start.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where bash commands with backslash-newline continuation lines (e.g., long commands split across multiple lines with <code>\\</code>) would produce spurious empty arguments, potentially breaking command execution.</li>\n<li>Fixed built-in slash commands (<code>/help</code>, <code>/model</code>, <code>/compact</code>, etc.) being hidden from the autocomplete dropdown when many user skills are installed (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/22020\">#22020</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed MCP servers

teammates (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26064\">#26064</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed plan mode being lost after context compaction, causing the model to switch from planning to implementation mode (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26061\">#26061</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed

    "summary": "AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.",

    "summary": "We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.",
