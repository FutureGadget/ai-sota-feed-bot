    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.5\">Qwen3.5: Towards Native Multimodal Agents</a></strong></p>\nAlibaba's Qwen just released the first two models in the Qwen 3.5 series - one open weights, one proprietary. Both are multi-modal for vision input.</p>\n<p>The open weight one is a Mixture of Experts model called Qwen3.5-397B-A17B. Interesting to see Qwen call out serving efficiency as a benefit of that architecture:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Built on an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention (via Gated Delta Networks) with a sparse mixture-of-experts, the model attains remarkable inference efficiency: although it comprises 397 billion total parameters, just 17 billion are activated per forward pass, optimizing both speed and cost without sacrificing capability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B\">807GB on Hugging Face</a>, and Unsloth have a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-GGUF\">collection of smaller GGUFs</a> ranging in size from 94.2GB 1-bit to 462GB Q8_K_XL.</p>\n<p>I got this <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/\">pelican</a> from the <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b\">OpenRouter hosted model</a> (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/625546cf6b371f9c0040e64492943b82\">transcript</a>):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Pelican is quite good although the neck lacks an outline for some reason. Bicycle is very basic with an incomplete frame\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/qwen3.5-397b-a17b.png\" /></p>\n<p>The proprietary hosted model is called Qwen3.5 Plus 2026-02-15, and is a little confusing. Qwen researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/2023340126479569140\">Junyang Lin  says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Qwen3-Plus is a hosted API version of 397B. As the model natively supports 256K tokens, Qwen3.5-Plus supports 1M token context length. Additionally it supports search and code interpreter, which you can use on Qwen Chat with Auto mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/9507dd47483f78dc1195117735273e20\">its pelican</a>, which is similar in quality to the open weights model:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Similar quality pelican.

    "summary": "<p>I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/10/showboat-and-rodney/\">introduced Showboat</a> a week ago - my CLI tool that helps coding agents create Markdown documents that demonstrate the code that they have created. I've been finding new ways to use it on a daily basis, and I've just released two new tools to help get the best out of the Showboat pattern. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom\">Chartroom</a> is a CLI charting tool that works well with Showboat, and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</a> lets Showboat's new remote publishing feature incrementally push documents to a Datasette instance.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#showboat-remote-publishing\">Showboat remote publishing</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#chartroom\">Chartroom</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#how-i-built-chartroom\">How I built Chartroom</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/chartroom-and-datasette-showboat/#the-burgeoning-showboat-ecosystem\">The burgeoning Showboat ecosystem</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"showboat-remote-publishing\">Showboat remote publishing</h4>\n<p>I normally use Showboat in Claude Code for web (see <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/16/rodney-claude-code/\">note from this morning</a>). I've used it in several different projects in the past few days, each of them with a prompt that looks something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Use \"uvx showboat --help\" to perform a very thorough investigation of what happens if you use the Python sqlite-chronicle and sqlite-history-json libraries against the same SQLite database table</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/sqlite-chronicle-vs-history-json/demo.md\">the resulting document</a>.</p>\n<p>Just telling Claude Code to run <code>uvx showboat --help</code> is enough for it to learn how to use the tool - the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">help text</a> is designed to work as a sort of ad-hoc Skill document.</p>\n<p>The one catch with this approach is that I can't <em>see</em> the new Showboat document until it's finished. I have to wait for Claude to commit the document plus embedded screenshots and push that to a branch in my GitHub repo - then I can view it through the GitHub interface.</p>\n<p>For a while I've been thinking it would be neat to have a remote web server of my own which Claude instances can submit updates to while they are working. Then this morning I realized Showboat might be the ideal mechanism to set that up...</p>\n<p>Showboat <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/releases/tag/v0.6.0\">v0.6.0</a> adds a new \"remote\" feature. It's almost invisible to users of the tool itself, instead being configured by an environment variable.</p>\n<p>Set a variable like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL=https://www.example.com/submit<span class=\"pl-k\">?</span>token=xyz</pre></div>\n<p>And every time you run a <code>showboat init</code> or <code>showboat note</code> or <code>showboat exec</code> or <code>showboat image</code> command the resulting document fragments will be POSTed to that API endpoint, in addition to the Showboat Markdown file itself being updated.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/v0.6.0/README.md#remote-document-streaming\">full details in the Showboat README</a> - it's a very simple API format, using regular POST form variables or a multipart form upload for the image attached to <code>showboat image</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</h4>\n<p>It's simple enough to build a webapp to receive these updates from Showboat, but I needed one that I could easily deploy and would work well with the rest of my personal ecosystem.</p>\n<p>So I had Claude Code write me a Datasette plugin that could act as a Showboat remote endpoint. I actually had this building at the same time as the Showboat remote feature, a neat example of running <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/\">parallel agents</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</a></strong> is a Datasette plugin that adds a <code>/-/showboat</code> endpoint to Datasette for viewing documents and a <code>/-/showboat/receive</code> endpoint for receiving updates from Showboat.</p>\n<p>Here's a very quick way to try it out:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx --with datasette-showboat --prerelease=allow \\\n  datasette showboat.db --create \\\n  -s plugins.datasette-showboat.database showboat \\\n  -s plugins.datasette-showboat.token secret123 \\\n  --root --secret cookie-secret-123</pre></div>\n<p>Click on the sign in as root link that shows up in the console, then navigate to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat\">http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat</a> to see the interface.</p>\n<p>Now set your environment variable to point to this instance:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat/receive?token=secret123<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>And run Showboat like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Showboat Feature Demo<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Refresh that page and you should see this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Title: Showboat. Remote viewer for Showboat documents. Showboat Feature Demo 2026-02-17 00:06 · 6 chunks, UUID. To send showboat output to this server, set the SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL environment variable: export SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/showboat/receive?token=your-token&quot;\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/datasette-showboat-documents.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Click through to the document, then start Claude Code or Codex or your agent of choice and prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run 'uvx showboat --help' and then use showboat to add to the existing demo.md document with notes and exec and image to demonstrate the tool - fetch a placekitten for the image demo.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>init</code> command assigns a UUID and title and sends those up to Datasette.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Animated demo - in the foreground a terminal window runs Claude Code, which executes various Showboat commands. In the background a Firefox window where the Showboat Feature Demo adds notes then some bash commands, then a placekitten image.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/datasette-showboat.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The best part of this is that it works in Claude Code for web. Run the plugin on a server somewhere (an exercise left up to the reader - I use <a href=\"https://fly.io/\">Fly.io</a> to host mine) and set that <code>SHOWBOAT_REMOTE_URL</code> environment variable in your Claude environment, then any time you tell it to use Showboat the document it creates will be transmitted to your server and viewable in real time.</p>\n<p>I built <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/10/showboat-and-rodney/#rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney</a>, a CLI browser automation tool, specifically to work with Showboat. It makes it easy to have a Showboat document load up web pages, interact with them via clicks or injected JavaScript and captures screenshots to embed in the Showboat document and show the effects.</p>\n<p>This is wildly useful for hacking on web interfaces using Claude Code for web, especially when coupled with the new remote publishing feature. I only got this stuff working this morning and I've already had several sessions where Claude Code has published screenshots of its work in progress, which I've then been able to provide feedback on directly in the Claude session while it's still working.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chartroom\">Chartroom</h3>\n<p>A few days ago I had another idea for a way to extend the Showboat ecosystem: what if Showboat documents could easily include charts?</p>\n<p>I sometimes fire up Claude Code for data analysis tasks, often telling it to download a SQLite database and then run queries against it to figure out interesting things from the data.</p>\n<p>With a simple CLI tool that produced PNG images I could have Claude use Showboat to build a document with embedded charts to help illustrate its findings.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom\">Chartroom</a></strong> is exactly that. It's effectively a thin wrapper around the excellent <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">matplotlib</a> Python library, designed to be used by coding agents to create charts that can be embedded in Showboat documents.</p>\n<p>Here's how to render a simple bar chart:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">echo</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,value</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Alice,42</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Bob,28</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Charlie,35</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Diana,51</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Eve,19<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uvx chartroom bar --csv \\\n  --title <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales by Person<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> --ylabel <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/chartroom/8812afc02e1310e9eddbb56508b06005ff2c0ed5/demo/1f6851ec-2026-02-14.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"A chart of those numbers, with a title and y-axis label\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/chartroom/8812afc02e1310e9eddbb56508b06005ff2c0ed5/demo/1f6851ec-2026-02-14.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>It can also do line charts, bar charts, scatter charts, and histograms - as seen in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom/blob/0.2.1/demo/README.md\">this demo document</a> that was built using Showboat.</p>\n<p>Chartroom can also generate alt text. If you add <code>-f alt</code> to the above it will output the alt text for the chart instead of the image:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">echo</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,value</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Alice,42</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Bob,28</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Charlie,35</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Diana,51</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">Eve,19<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uvx chartroom bar --csv \\\n  --title <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales by Person<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> --ylabel <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Sales<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> -f alt</pre></div>\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n<pre><code>Sales by Person. Bar chart of value by name — Alice: 42, Bob: 28, Charlie: 35, Diana: 51, Eve: 19\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can use <code>-f html</code> or <code>-f markdown</code> to get the image tag with alt text directly:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-text-md\"><pre><span class=\"pl-s\">![</span>Sales by Person. Bar chart of value by name — Alice: 42, Bob: 28, Charlie: 35, Diana: 51, Eve: 19<span class=\"pl-s\">]</span><span class=\"pl-s\">(</span><span class=\"pl-corl\">/Users/simon/chart-7.png</span><span class=\"pl-s\">)</span></pre></div>\n<p>I added support for Markdown images with alt text to Showboat in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/releases/tag/v0.5.0\">v0.5.0</a>, to complement this feature of Chartroom.</p>\n<p>Finally, Chartroom has support for different <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html\">matplotlib styles</a>. I had Claude build a Showboat document to demonstrate these all in one place - you can see that at <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom/blob/main/demo/styles.md\">demo/styles.md</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-i-built-chartroom\">How I built Chartroom</h4>\n<p>I started the Chartroom repository with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/click-app\">click-app</a> cookiecutter template, then told a fresh Claude Code for web session:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are building a Python CLI tool which uses matplotlib to generate a PNG image containing a chart. It will have multiple sub commands for different chart types, controlled by command line options. Everything you need to know to use it will be available in the single \"chartroom --help\" output.</p>\n<p>It will accept data from files or standard input as CSV or TSV or JSON, similar to how sqlite-utils accepts data - clone simonw/sqlite-utils to /tmp for reference there. Clone matplotlib/matplotlib for reference as well</p>\n<p>It will also accept data from --sql path/to/sqlite.db \"select ...\" which runs in read-only mode</p>\n<p>Start by asking clarifying questions - do not use the ask user tool though it is broken - and generate a spec for me to approve</p>\n<p>Once approved proceed using red/green TDD running tests with \"uv run pytest\"</p>\n<p>Also while building maintain a demo/README.md document using the \"uvx showboat --help\" tool - each time you get a new chart type working commit the tests, implementation, root level\nREADME update and a new version of that demo/README.md document with an inline image demo of the new chart type (which should be a UUID image filename managed by the showboat image command and should be stored in the demo/ folder</p>\n<p>Make sure \"uv build\" runs cleanly without complaining about extra directories but also ensure dist/ and uv.lock are in gitignore</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This got most of the work done. You can see the rest <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">in the PRs</a> that followed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-burgeoning-showboat-ecosystem\">The burgeoning Showboat ecosystem</h4>\n<p>The Showboat family of tools now consists of <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a> itself, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney\">Rodney</a> for browser automation, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/chartroom\">Chartroom</a> for charting and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-showboat\">datasette-showboat</a> for streaming remote Showboat documents to Datasette.</p>\n<p>I'm enjoying how these tools can operate together based on a very loose set of conventions. If a tool can output a path to an image Showboat can include that image in a document. Any tool that can output text can be used with Showboat.</p>\n<p>I'll almost certainly be building more tools that fit this pattern. They're very quick to knock out!</p>\n<p>The environment variable mechanism for Showboat's remote streaming is a fun hack too - so far I'm just using it to stream documents somewhere else, but it's effectively a webhook extension mechanism that could likely be used for all sorts of things I haven't thought of yet.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/charting\">charting</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette\">datasette</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/showboat\">showboat</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p>Think about ordering pizza. Instead of opening DoorDash, browsing restaurants, customizing your order, and checking out, you could just say \"Hey AI, order me a pepperoni pizza.\" Done. When you think about it that way, why would anyone need DoorDash anymore?<p>For simple stuff like this, yeah, AI replacing apps feels inevitable. But I've been thinking about the harder cases, and I'm not so sure.<p>## Most real-world apps solve really messy problems<p>Take something like Jira. It's not just a pretty interface sitting on top of simple logic. Jira is enforcing workflows across teams, managing who can see what, tracking state changes, hooking into CI/CD, keeping audit trails, all while dozens of people with different roles are working in it at the same time. Can you honestly replace all of that with \"Hey AI, manage my project\"?<p>## And then there's the cost<p>Here's the part that I think people aren't talking about enough.<p>Let's say you need to build a complex financial model in a spreadsheet. Hundreds of rows, nested formulas, pivot tables, cross-sheet references, the whole thing. Now imagine trying to do that entirely by talking to AI.<p>\"Move that column.\" \"No, the other one.\" \"Now add a VLOOKUP that pulls from the other sheet.\" \"Actually, the range is wrong.\" Every single back-and-forth is burning tokens. If the model is complex enough, you could easily spend more on AI inference in one sitting than you'd pay for Excel for an entire year. And the spreadsheet app just... does it. Deterministic logic, minimal compute, instant feedback.<p>I think this pattern holds more broadly than people realize: the more complex and repetitive the task, the more tokens you burn, and the harder it is for \"just ask AI\" to compete with a $10/month app on cost alone.<p>Here's where it gets ironic, though. AI coding agents like Cursor and Claude Code are making it way cheaper to <i>build</i> apps. So AI might not shrink the app market at all. It could actually grow it by making apps cheaper to create, while simultaneously making \"just use AI directly\" expensive for anything non-trivial.<p>*Curious what HN thinks:*<p>- Are we overestimating AI's ability to replace purpose-built software?<p>- Will inference costs drop and AI capabilities advance enough to make this argument irrelevant?<p>- Or will everyone just become a developer, building their own apps for their own needs?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47054299\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47054299</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14955v1",
    "summary": "We present a domain-grounded framework and benchmark for tool-aware plan generation in contact centers, where answering a query for business insights, our target use case, requires decomposing it into executable steps over structured tools (Text2SQL (T2S)/Snowflake) and unstructured tools (RAG/transcripts) with explicit depends_on for parallelism. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the \"A+\" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.",
