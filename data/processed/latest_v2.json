    "summary": "<h2>What's changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for <code>startupTimeout</code> configuration for LSP servers</li>\n<li>Added <code>WorktreeCreate</code> and <code>WorktreeRemove</code> hook events, enabling custom VCS setup and teardown when agent worktree isolation creates or removes worktrees.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where resumed sessions could be invisible when the working directory involved symlinks, because the session storage path was resolved at different times during startup. Also fixed session data loss on SSH disconnect by flushing session data before hooks and analytics in the graceful shutdown sequence.</li>\n<li>Linux: Fixed native modules not loading on systems with glibc older than 2.30 (e.g., RHEL 8)</li>\n<li>Fixed memory leak in agent teams where completed teammate tasks were never garbage collected from session state</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE</code> to fully strip down skills, session memory, custom agents, and CLAUDE.md token counting</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>/mcp reconnect</code> freezing the CLI when given a server name that doesn't exist</li>\n<li>Fixed memory leak where completed task state objects were never removed from AppState</li>\n<li>Added support for <code>isolation: worktree</code> in agent definitions, allowing agents to declaratively run in isolated git worktrees.</li>\n<li><code>CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE</code> mode now also disables MCP tools, attachments, hooks, and CLAUDE.md file loading for a fully minimal experience.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where MCP tools were not discovered when tool search is enabled and a prompt is passed in as a launch argument</li>\n<li>Improved memory usage during long sessions by clearing internal caches after compaction</li>\n<li>Added <code>claude agents</code> CLI command to list all configured agents</li>\n<li>Improved memory usage during long sessions by clearing large tool results after they have been processed</li>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak where LSP diagnostic data was never cleaned up after delivery, causing unbounded memory growth in long sessions</li>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak where completed task output was not freed from memory, reducing memory usage in long sessions with many tasks</li>\n<li>Improved startup performance for headless mode (<code>-p</code> flag) by deferring Yoga WASM and UI component imports</li>\n<li>Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates</li>\n<li>Fixed unbounded memory growth in long sessions by capping file history snapshots</li>\n<li>Added <code>CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT</code> environment variable to disable 1M context window support</li>\n<li>Opus 4.6 (fast mode) now includes the full 1M context window</li>\n<li>VSCode: Added <code>/extra-usage</code> command support in VS Code sessions</li>\n<li>Fixed memory leak where TaskOutput retained recent lines after cleanup</li>\n<li>Fixed memory leak in CircularBuffer where cleared items were retained in the backing array</li>\n<li>Fixed memory leak in shell command execution where ChildProcess and AbortController references were retained after cleanup</li>\n</ul>",

    "url": "https://github.com/revanthpobala/agentic-gatekeeper",
    "summary": "<p>Hey HN,<p>I built Agentic Gatekeeper, a headless pre-commit hook baked into the VS Code Source Control panel that autonomously patches code before you commit it.<p>The Problem: Whether I'm writing code manually or letting LLMs (Cursor/Copilot) generate it, keeping logic strictly in pace with local project rules (like CONTRIBUTING.md or custom architecture guidelines) is tedious. Standard linters catch syntax, but they don't catch business logic or state \"You must use the Fetch wrapper for API calls in this folder\".<p>How it works:\nWhen you stage files and trigger the hook, the extension spins up a parallel execution engine using the latest frontier models (Claude 4.6, DeepSeek V4, or local Ollama). It parses your workspace for local routing rules (e.g., .gatekeeper/*.md), evaluates the raw Git diffs, and utilizes the native VS Code WorkspaceEdit API to instantly auto-patch the logic errors directly in your editor.<p>It basically turns plain-English markdown into strict compiler rules that the IDE enforces before a bad commit is made.<p>The biggest challenge was handling multi-file concurrency and preventing race conditions when evaluating massive diffs, so I implemented a batched validation loop with explicit rollback safety checks. It natively supports OpenRouter so you can hot-swap models.<p>It's completely open-source. I'd love for you to try breaking it on a messy branch or poke around the multi-provider abstraction layer in the repo.<p>VS Code Marketplace: <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=revanthpobala.agentic-gatekeeper\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=revanthp...</a>\nGitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/revanthpobala/agentic-gatekeeper\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/revanthpobala/agentic-gatekeeper</a><p>Would love your technical feedback on the prompt orchestration or the VS Code API integration!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47106754\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47106754</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. [...]</p>\n<p>Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes).

The good news is that this kind of integration project is the kind of thing that coding agents <em>really</em> excel at. I knocked most of the feature out in a single morning while working in parallel on various other things.</p>\n<p>I didn't have a useful structured feed of my Research projects, and it didn't matter because I gave Claude Code a link to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/research/refs/heads/main/README.md\">the raw Markdown README</a> that lists them all and it <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/blob/f883b92be23892d082de39dbada571e406f5cfbf/blog/importers.py#L77-L80\">spun up a parser regex</a>. Since I'm responsible for both the source and the destination I'm fine with a brittle solution that would be too risky against a source that I don't control myself.</p>\n<p>Claude also handled all of the potentially tedious UI integration work with my site, making sure the new content worked on all of my different page types and was handled correctly by my <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/5/django-postgresql-faceted-search/\">faceted search engine</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"prototyping-with-claude-artifacts\">Prototyping with Claude Artifacts</h4>\n<p>I actually prototyped the initial concept for beats in regular Claude - not Claude Code - taking advantage of the fact that it can clone public repos from GitHub these days. I started with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Clone simonw/simonwillisonblog and tell me about the models and views</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then later in the brainstorming session said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>use the templates and CSS in this repo to create a new artifact with all HTML and CSS inline that shows me my homepage with some of those inline content types mixed in</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After some iteration we got to <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?c3f443cc4451cf8ce03a2715a43581a4/preview.html\">this artifact mockup</a>, which was enough to convince me that the concept had legs and was worth handing over to full <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web\">Claude Code for web</a> to implement.</p>\n<p>If you want to see how the rest of the build played out the most interesting PRs are <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/592\">Beats #592</a> which implemented the core feature and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/595/changes\">Add Museums Beat importer #595</a> which added the Museums content type.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/blogging\">blogging</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/museums\">museums</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/til\">til</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts\">claude-artifacts</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a></p>",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547v1",
    "summary": "This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.",

    "title": "Revisiting Weight Regularization for Low-Rank Continual Learning",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17559v1",
    "summary": "Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.
