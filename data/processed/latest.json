    "summary": "<p>We coined a new term on the <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/\">Oxide and Friends podcast</a> last month (primary credit to Adam Leventhal) covering the sense of psychological ennui leading into existential dread that many software developers are feeling thanks to the encroachment of generative AI into their field of work.</p>\n<p>We're calling it <strong>Deep Blue</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can listen to it being coined in real time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&amp;t=2835s\">from 47:15 in the episode</a>. I've included <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/15/deep-blue/#transcript\">a transcript below</a>.</p>\n<p>Deep Blue is a very real issue.</p>\n<p>Becoming a professional software engineer is <em>hard</em>. Getting good enough for people to pay you money to write software takes years of dedicated work. The rewards are significant: this is a well compensated career which opens up a lot of great opportunities.</p>\n<p>It's also a career that's mostly free from gatekeepers and expensive prerequisites. You don't need an expensive degree or accreditation. A laptop, an internet connection and a lot of time and curiosity is enough to get you started.</p>\n<p>And it rewards the nerds! Spending your teenage years tinkering with computers turned out to be a very smart investment in your future.</p>\n<p>The idea that this could all be stripped away by a chatbot is <em>deeply</em> upsetting.</p>\n<p>I've seen signs of Deep Blue in most of the online communities I spend time in. I've even faced accusations from my peers that I am actively harming their future careers through my work helping people understand how well AI-assisted programming can work.</p>\n<p>I think this is an issue which is causing genuine mental anguish for a lot of people in our community. Giving it a name makes it easier for us to have conversations about it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"my-experiences-of-deep-blue\">My experiences of Deep Blue</h4>\n<p>I distinctly remember my first experience of Deep Blue. For me it was triggered by ChatGPT Code Interpreter back in early 2023.</p>\n<p>My primary project is <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a>, an ecosystem of open source tools for telling stories with data. I had dedicated myself to the challenge of helping people (initially focusing on journalists) clean up, analyze and find meaning in data, in all sorts of shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>I expected I would need to build a lot of software for this! It felt like a challenge that could keep me happily engaged for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Then I tried uploading a CSV file of <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data\">San Francisco Police Department Incident Reports</a> - hundreds of thousands of rows - to ChatGPT Code Interpreter and... it did every piece of data cleanup and analysis I had on my napkin roadmap for the next few years with a couple of prompts.</p>\n<p>It even converted the data into a neatly normalized SQLite database and let me download the result!</p>\n<p>I remember having two competing thoughts in parallel.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, as somebody who wants journalists to be able to do more with data, this felt like a <em>huge</em> breakthrough. Imagine giving every journalist in the world an on-demand analyst who could help them tackle any data question they could think of!</p>\n<p>But on the other hand... <em>what was I even for</em>? My confidence in the value of my own projects took a painful hit. Was the path I'd chosen for myself suddenly a dead end?</p>\n<p>I've had some further pangs of Deep Blue just in the past few weeks, thanks to the Claude Opus 4.5/4.6 and GPT-5.2/5.3 coding agent effect. As many other people are also observing, the latest generation of coding agents, given the right prompts, really can churn away for a few minutes to several hours and produce working, documented and fully tested software that exactly matches the criteria they were given.</p>\n<p>\"The code they write isn't any good\" doesn't really cut it any more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"transcript\">A lightly edited transcript</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: I think that we're going to see a real problem with AI induced ennui where software engineers in particular get listless because the AI can do anything. Simon, what do you think about that?</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: Definitely. Anyone who's paying close attention to coding agents is feeling some of that already. There's an extent where you sort of get over it when you realize that you're still useful, even though your ability to memorize the syntax of program languages is completely irrelevant now.</p>\n<p>Something I see a lot of is people out there who are having existential crises and are very, very unhappy because they're like, \"I dedicated my career to learning this thing and now it just does it. What am I even for?\". I will very happily try and convince those people that they are for a whole bunch of things and that none of that experience they've accumulated has gone to waste, but psychologically it's a difficult time for software engineers.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: Okay, so I'm going to predict that we name that. Whatever that is, we have a name for that kind of feeling and that kind of, whether you want to call it a blueness or a loss of purpose, and that we're kind of trying to address it collectively in a directed way.</p>\n<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Okay, this is your big moment. Pick the name. If you call your shot from here, this is you pointing to the stands. You know, I – Like deep blue, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Bryan</strong>: Yeah, deep blue. I like that. I like deep blue. Deep blue. Oh, did you walk me into that, you bastard? You just blew out the candles on my birthday cake.</p>\n<p>It wasn't my big moment at all. That was your big moment. No, that is, Adam, that is very good. That is deep blue.</p>\n<p><strong>Simon</strong>: All of the chess players and the Go players went through this a decade ago and they have come out stronger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Turns out it was more than a decade ago: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\">Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997</a>.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/careers\">careers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/oxide\">oxide</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/bryan-cantrill\">bryan-cantrill</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a></p>",

The pelican features a light blue eye, a pink cheek blush, a massive bill with a vertical gradient from yellow to orange, a backward magenta cap with a cyan brim and a small yellow top button, and a matching magenta scarf blowing backward in the wind. Its white wing, accented with a grey mid-section and dark blue feather tips, reaches forward to grip the handlebars, while its long tan leg and orange foot press down on an orange pedal. Attached to the front handlebars is a white wire basket carrying a bright blue cartoon fish that is pointing upwards and forwards. The bicycle itself has a cyan frame, dark blue tires, striking neon pink inner rims, cyan spokes, a white front chainring, and a dark blue chain. Behind the pelican, a grey trapezoidal pier extends from the sand toward a horizontal band of deep blue ocean water detailed with light cyan wavy lines. A massive, solid yellow-orange semi-circle sun sits on the horizon line, setting directly behind the bicycle frame. The background sky is a smooth vertical gradient transitioning from soft pink at the top to warm golden-yellow at the horizon, decorated with stylized pale peach fluffy clouds, thin white horizontal wind streaks, twinkling four-pointed white stars, and small brown v-shaped silhouettes of distant flying birds.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-pelican.png\" /></p>\n<p>(And since it's an FAQ, here's my answer to <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/13/training-for-pelicans-riding-bicycles/\">What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles?</a>)</p>\n<p>Since it did so well on my basic <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code> I decided to try the <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/18/gemini-3/#and-a-new-pelican-benchmark\">more challenging version</a> as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers. The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle.

The bird leans horizontally over the frame in an aerodynamic racing posture, with thin, dark brown wing-like arms reaching forward to grip the silver handlebars and a single thick brown leg, patterned with white V-shapes, stretching down to press on a black pedal. The bird's most prominent and striking feature is an enormous, vividly bright red, inflated throat pouch hanging beneath a long, straight grey upper beak that ends in a small orange hook. Its head is mostly white with a small pink patch surrounding the eye, a dark brown stripe running down the back of its neck, and a distinctive curly pale yellow crest on the very top. The bird's round, dark brown body shares the same repeating white V-shaped feather pattern as its leg and is accented by a folded wing resting on its side, made up of cleanly layered light blue and grey feathers. A tail composed of four stiff, straight dark brown feathers extends directly backward. Thin white horizontal speed lines trail behind the back wheel and the bird's tail, emphasizing swift forward motion. The bicycle features a classic diamond frame, large wheels with thin black tires, grey rims, and detailed silver spokes, along with a clearly visible front chainring, silver chain, and rear cog. The whimsical scene is set against a clear light blue sky featuring two small, fluffy white clouds on the left and a large, pale yellow sun in the upper right corner that radiates soft, concentric, semi-transparent pastel green and yellow halos. A solid, darker brown shadow is cast directly beneath the bicycle's wheels on the minimalist two-toned brown ground.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-complex-pelican.png\" />\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991240\">Hacker News</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/google\">google</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/gemini\">gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle\">pelican-riding-a-bicycle</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-reasoning\">llm-reasoning</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-release\">llm-release</a></p>",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12241v1",
    "summary": "Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.",

    "title": "Statistical Parsing for Logical Information Retrieval",
    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12170v1",
    "summary": "In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.\n  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.\n  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's \"bitter lesson\" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier.

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12159v1",
    "summary": "Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/",
