    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v1",
    "summary": "The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12279v1",
    "summary": "Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12274v1",
    "summary": "Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth. Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.",

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt</a></strong></p>\nThis piece by Margaret-Anne Storey is the best explanation of the term <strong>cognitive debt</strong> I've seen so far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cognitive debt</em>, a term gaining <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/\">traction</a> recently, instead communicates the notion that the debt compounded from going fast lives in the brains of the developers and affects their lived experiences and abilities to “go fast” or to make changes. Even if AI agents produce code that could be easy to understand, the humans involved may have simply lost the plot and may not understand what the program is supposed to do, how their intentions were implemented, or how to possibly change it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Margaret-Anne expands on this further with an anecdote about a student team she coached:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But by weeks 7 or 8, one team hit a wall. They could no longer make even simple changes without breaking something unexpected. When I met with them, the team initially blamed technical debt: messy code, poor architecture, hurried implementations. But as we dug deeper, the real problem emerged: no one on the team could explain why certain design decisions had been made or how different parts of the system were supposed to work together. The code might have been messy, but the bigger issue was that the theory of the system, their shared understanding, had fragmented or disappeared entirely. They had accumulated cognitive debt faster than technical debt, and it paralyzed them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've experienced this myself on some of my more ambitious vibe-code-adjacent projects. I've been experimenting with prompting entire new features into existence without reviewing their implementations and, while it works surprisingly well, I've found myself getting lost in my own projects.</p>\n<p>I no longer have a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work, which means each additional feature becomes harder to reason about, eventually leading me to lose the ability to make confident decisions about where to go next.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-02-13.html\">Martin Fowler</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2026/02/launching-interop-2026/\">Launching Interop 2026</a></strong></p>\nJake Archibald reports on Interop 2026, the initiative between Apple, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla to collaborate on ensuring a targeted set of web platform features reach cross-browser parity over the course of the year.</p>\n<p>I hadn't realized how influential and successful the Interop series has been. It started back in 2021 as <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/compat2021\">Compat 2021</a> before being rebranded to Interop <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2022/03/03/microsoft-edge-and-interop-2022/\">in 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>The dashboards for each year can be seen here, and they demonstrate how wildly effective the program has been: <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2021\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022\">2022</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023\">2023</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024\">2024</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2025\">2025</a>, <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2026\">2026</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's the progress chart for 2025, which shows every browser vendor racing towards a 95%+ score by the end of the year:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Line chart showing Interop 2025 browser compatibility scores over the year (Jan–Dec) for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Interop. Y-axis ranges from 0% to 100%. Chrome (yellow) and Edge (green) lead, starting around 80% and reaching near 100% by Dec. Firefox (orange) starts around 48% and climbs to ~98%. Safari (blue) starts around 45% and reaches ~96%. The Interop line (dark green/black) starts lowest around 29% and rises to ~95% by Dec. All browsers converge near 95–100% by year's end.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/interop-2025.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The feature I'm most excited about in 2026 is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#basic_mpa_view_transition\">Cross-document View Transitions</a>, building on the successful 2025 target of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using\">Same-Document View Transitions</a>. This will provide fancy SPA-style transitions between pages on websites with no JavaScript at all.</p>\n<p>As a keen WebAssembly tinkerer I'm also intrigued by this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration/blob/main/proposals/js-promise-integration/Overview.md\">JavaScript Promise Integration for Wasm</a> allows WebAssembly to asynchronously 'suspend', waiting on the result of an external promise. This simplifies the compilation of languages like C/C++ which expect APIs to run synchronously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/browsers\">browsers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/css\">css</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/javascript\">javascript</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/web-standards\">web-standards</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/webassembly\">webassembly</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/jake-archibald\">jake-archibald</a></p>",

    "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12273v1",
    "summary": "We propose an optimization-informed deep neural network approach, named iUzawa-Net, aiming for the first solver that enables real-time solutions for a class of nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed learnable neural networks. We prove universal approximation properties and establish the asymptotic $\\varepsilon$-optimality for the iUzawa-Net, and validate its promising numerical efficiency through nonsmooth elliptic and parabolic optimal control problems. Our techniques offer a versatile framework for designing and analyzing various optimization-informed deep learning approaches to optimal control and other PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed learning-to-control approach synergizes model-based optimization algorithms and data-driven deep learning techniques, inheriting the merits of both methodologies.",
