## 1. Show HN: Agent Audit Kit v0.1 – deterministic replay + stress for LLM agents
- Type: news | Source: hackernews_ai
- URL: https://github.com/helpfuldolphin/AgentAuditKit/releases/tag/aak-v0.1.0-e3
- Score: 3.558 | Reliability: 1.0
- Why it matters: Directly addresses agent harness/eval gap; deterministic replay + stress testing are core reliability patterns. Low HN signal (0 comments) limits evidence depth.
